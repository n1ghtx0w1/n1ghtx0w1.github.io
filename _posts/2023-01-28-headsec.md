## The New Domain - 

I didn’t like the cost of renewing the previous domain, so I've moved to (headsec.tech)[https://headsec.tech] for now.

Over the last year I’ve been really busy with family, work/career goals, and school.  I’m starting to focus myself into directions I hadn’t previously considered.  I was lacking the confidence as I transitioned from law enforcement into IT, but that is changing quickly.

Getting the ITIL certification helped me think about IT more from a business perspective and I’m looking to leverage that more going forward.

I love anything security and will incorporate that into everything I do.  It's a part of my character.  The same part that drove me towards law enforcment.  

It’s not easy to dust yourself off after you've just gotten back up.  I keep thinking about where I was just a few years ago and where I am today.  It’s incredible how much has changed for the better.  I can’t fathom where I will be if I keep my foot on the throttle.  

Here's some advice. 

- Don’t give up, ever!  This is your war and you may have lost a lot of battles.  Hang in there and win the war!  It’s not easy and I know that.  I don’t want to detail where I’ve been or where I’ve come from yet, but I never thought I’d be where I am today.  If I gave up I wouldn’t be here, and you wouldn’t be reading this.

- Look at jobs on various job boards and find something you are interested in, examine the requirements, and study those subjects.

- Imposter syndrome is good.  Use it to your advantage. Convince yourself you are going to become that role you imagine yourself filling, and set goals that you are able to achieve regularly so you feel accomplished.

- Make sure you take care of your issues.  Whatever else you’re dealing with needs attention, so make time for yourself to deal with any issues in your life.  Don’t put those off because they can derail the progress you are trying to make.  



You've got this. I believe in you!  If you need someone to communicate with feel free to contact me:
