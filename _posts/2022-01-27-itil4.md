The **ITIL** *(Information Technology Infrastructure Library)* is a framework designed to standardize the selection, planning, delivery, maintenance, and overall lifecycle of IT (information technology) services within a business. The goal is to improve efficiency and achieve predictable service delivery.

**Purpose:** To give students another means to study. I personally was looking for bedtime material, and wasn’t finding anything that fit my need. This led me to creating the [Quizlet ITIL4 Definitions Flashcards](https://quizlet.com/661294686/itil-4-definitions-flash-cards/), and this application. I made learning more engaging by putting my notes together into one place. I hope it helps someone else. Please feel free to make suggestions, give feedback, or let me know if you found this resource helpful [email](mailto:attacktheosi@gmail.com).

## **The Service Value System** (1)

The Service value system converts opportunity and demand by applying our own service management magic into actual value for our customers.

## **The Guiding Principles** (6)
 
*Recommendations that guide organizations in any circumstances, even for implementing ITIL 4*
 
- **Focus on Value**
  - Everything you do must be somehow (directly or indirectly) valuable to your stakeholders.
- **Start Where You Are**
  - Reuse existing resources whenever possible instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again.
- **Progress Iteratively With Feedback**
  - Don't do everything at once, take baby steps instead. Learning by doing with lots of feedback.
- **Collaborate and Promote Visibility**
  - Involve the right people at the right time and gather factual data to make the right decisions.  
- **Think and Work Holistically**
  - Nothing is ever alone. Think about the effect of your initiative or work on other components.
- **Keep it Simple and Practical**
  - Don’t overcomplicate work. Use the least possible steps. Outcome based thinking helps.
- **Optimize and Automate** 
  - Maximize the value of human work. Automate only after optimization.  Apply DevOps.

*Summary of the guiding principles*

- *Universally applicable to any work or initiative*

- *Represent well-proven, good practice*

- *Are neither prescriptive nor a must*

- *Can be applied stand-alone but are better in conjunction* 

- *Have a strong relation to Lean-Agile thinking*

## **The Service Value Chain** (2)

The service value chain is a part of the service value system. It's an operating model which utilizes value streams. It has 6 different activities that `transforms demand into value`.
 
**Value Stream:**

- A series of steps an organization takes to co-create value with customers.
- These steps can be mapped to the SVC (service value chain) in any combination.
- E.g. handling of incidents or developing new applications.
Value streams are focused on mapping the steps that are needed, and trying to find improvement opportunities in these steps. Find waste and eliminate it, and optimize flow to achieve value.

**Purpose of the Activities**

_**Plan**_
- Ensures shared understanding of vision, current status and direction

_**Improve**_
- Continual improvement of products and services

_**Engage**_
- Understand stakeholder needs and demands

_**Design and transition**_
- Make sure that services meet stakeholder needs

_**Obtain or build**_
- Ensure components are available when needed

_**Deliver and support**_
- Ensure SLA (service level agreement) conform service delivery

_**The service value chain**_
- **Is an operating model**
- **Outlines activities needed to transform demand into value**
- **`Universally applicable`**
- **Can be used for mapping Value Streams**
- **Practices include specific sequences of SVC activities**

## **Most Important Practices** (19)

- A practice is a set of organizational resources designed to perform work or accomplish an objective.

>  **`General Management Practices`** | **`Service Management Practices`** | **`Technical Management Practices`**
>  **Continual Improvement** | **Change Enablement**| Deployment Management  
>  Information Security Management | **Incident Management** |
>  Relationship management | IT Asset Management |

>   | **Service Level Management** |
>   | **Service Request Management** |

### **Continual Improvement Practice** 

- Continual improvement happens everywhere in the organization (SVS, SVC, practices).
- **Ideas need to be reprioritized when new ones are added.** `!`
- **It is a responsibility of everyone.** `!`
- Organizations may have Continual Improvement Team for better coordination.
- All 4 Dimensions need to be considered during any improvement initiative.

**What is the vision?**
- Align the mission and vision of improvement with the orginization. 

**Where are we now?**
- **Starting point of our improvement journey (guiding principal “start where you are”) where you are now.** `!`

**Where do we want to be?**
- Short term targets we need to achieve. Measurable targets (SMART Specifici, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound).

**How do we get there?**
- How do we want to achieve our measurable targets? Agile, waterfall, setup teams, and projects.

**Take action**
- Make sure we act on our plan of improvement.

**Did we get there?**
- Did we achieve our goal and what lessons were learned? 

**How do we keep the momentum going?**
- Make sure we are continuing to improve and not going back to old habbits.

### **Change Enablement Practice**
 
**Purpose:** *maximize the number of successful changes through proper risk assessment and minimize the negative impact of failed changes.*
 
**Types:**
- **Standard:** *Pre-authorized, low risk, low cost, basically Service Requests.*
 
- **Normal:** *Authorization depends on what kind of change it is. Goes through the normal change workflow.*
 
- **Emergency:** *Needs rapid action. May have a separate change authority.*

### **Incident Management Practice**
 
**Purpose:** *minimize negative impact of incidents by restoring normal operation as soon as possible.*
 
- **Incident:** _**unplanned interruption or reduction of quality. Must be logged, prioritized, and managed throughout their lifecycle. Uses the same categorizations as problem tickets. Swarming may help with complex issues.**_ `!`
 
- **Major Incidents:** _**need a separate procedure**_.`!` *Swarming can be used for faster solutions.*

### **Problem Management Practice**

 **Purpose:** *reduce likelihood of recurring incidents by identifying root causes and eliminating them.*
 
- **Problem:** **Unknown cause of one or more incidents.** `!`
- **Known Error:** A problem with a known root case but no solution yet.
- **Workaround:** Alternate solution, reducing the impact of the problem.
 
**Phases:** **Problem Identification > Problem Control > Error Control** `!`

- **Problem Identification:** create a problem ticket and assign it to the correct team.
- **Problem Control:** joint effort between teams to analyze the problem, find the root cause, and provide a workaround for it.
- **Error Control:** initiate a change ticket, or request for changes if necessary. Changing something in the infrastructure, applications, configurations, or the code. A control practice needs to be in place which is the change enablement practice in this case!

### **Service Desk Practice**
 
**Purpose:** *capture demand for the incidents and service requests.  Single point of contact between service provider and users.*
 
Issues request queries > SPOC > Acknowledge > Classify > Own > Act
 
**Channels:**

E-Mail | Self-Service 
Phone | Text Messaging
Chat | Forums
 
**Skills:**

- **Incident analysis and prioritization** `!`
- Effective communication
- Emotional intelligence
- Excellent customer service skills

### **Service Level Management Practice**
 
**Purpose:** *to set clear business-based targets for service performance, so that the delivery of a service can be measured properly.* 
 
**SLA:** **Service Level Agreement between customer, and service providers.** `!`

**OLA:** Operational Level Agreement between different units of the same organization.

**UC:** Underpinning Contracts are an agreement between service provider and external supplier.
 
**Recommendations:**

- **CLear language, no jargon** `!`
- **Should relate to defined outcomes** `!`
- **Simply written, easy to understand** `!` 
- **Listen actively to customer needs** `!`

### **Service Request Management Practice**
 
**Purpose:** *to support the agreed quality of services by handling all pre-defined, user initiated service requests.*
 
**Service Request:** a formal request for something other than incident resolution (e.g. information, advice, how-to questions…)
 
Steps to fulfill requests should be **well known** (for both simple and complex requests). `!`

When defining new workflows, try to **reuse** already existing ones. `!`

User expectations must be managed in regards to what can be delivered.

![Desktop View](https://s7280.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Software_Requirements_Specification_Final.jpg.optimal.jpg){: w="700" h="400" }
 
### **Supplier Management Practice** 
Ensures that the supplier of the organization and their performances are managed to support seamless service provision to customers.
 
The goal is to make sure “we get what we paid for” from our vendors and suppliers.
 
Agreements and contracts are made in the form of UC’s (Underpinning Contracts).

### **IT Asset Management Practice** 
Plans and manages the full lifecycle of IT assets to:
- Maximize their value
- Control their costs
- Support decisions about reusing or purchasing new assets
  - **IT Asset** *any financially valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of IT products or services.*
 
### **Monitoring & Event Management Practice** 
Observes services and components and records changes in their state.  Identifies those events, categorizes them and establishes standard responses.
 
- **Event:** any change of state that has significance for the management of a configuration item or service.

- **Types:** Informational, Warning, Exception
 
### **Release Management Practice** 
Makes new and changed services and features available for use.
 
- **Release:** a version of a service or other configuration items, or a collection of configuration items, that is made available for use.
 
- Releases have been disconnected from deployments with **canary / dark releases.**

**Other Practices**
 
### **Service Configuration Management Practice** 
Ensures accurate information is available when needed about services, configuration items and their relationships.
 
**CI (Configuration Item):** any component that needs to be managed to deliver an IT service.
 
**CMDB (Configuration Management Database):** a database or collection of databases holding CIs and their connections.
 
**CMS (Configuration Management System):** a frontend / user interface for CMDBs.
 
### **Deployment Management Practice** 
Moves new or changed hardware, software documentation or any other components from one environment to the next. E.g. Dev > QA > PROD
 
With the help of DevOps we can reach continuous delivery, where the developer builds the change in DEV, which is automatically tested and moved to the next environment until it arrives in PROD. **Deployment does not equal release.**

**Summary**

Remember at least the purpose for the following practices:
> To ensure...
- Information Security Management 
- Relationship Management 
- Supplier Management
- IT Asset Management 
- Monitoring & Event Management
- Release Management
- Service Configuration Management
