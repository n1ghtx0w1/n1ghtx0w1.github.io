## Systems Administration: Cyber Defense Edition

**Author:** Agustin Castro

**Framework Category:** Protect and Defend

**Specialty Area:** Cybersecurity Defense Infrastructure Support

**Work Role:** Cyber Defense Infrastructure Support Specialist

**Task Description:** Perform system administration on specialized cyber defense applications and systems (e.g., antivirus, audit and remediation) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices, to include installation, configuration, maintenance, backup, and restoration. (T0180)
Scenario

Our managed service provider has notified us that an important system/application is either missing or no longer functioning properly. This has brought the companyâ€™s current cyber defense posture below an acceptable baseline. Confirm the system/application that the managed service provider has identified with engineering and then correct the issue as soon as possible.

_**Additional Information**_

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.

You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.

Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...

**Username:** *playerone*

**Password:** *password123*

The username/password used to access the Firewall's web interface within the workspace will be the following...

**Username:** *admin*
**Password:** *password123*

## Mission Start

On, 06-Feb-2022, at approximately 14:00 hours CST, I, was informed the following by our team:

```plain-text

Ashley Steele:
"So, our MSP just contacted me stating that they no longer 
have a connection to the Centipede POS system. I know we 
had a working vpn connection just a few days ago, so I'm 
not sure whats going on."

Ricardo Cortes:
"Woah, now! We can't let this persist. I don't even want 
to think about all the sales we're losing out on because 
of this. @jraffin, I need you to get us some information. 
Stat!"

Jacques Raffin:
"Yeah, I just got off the phone with one of the managers 
at the Centipede location. It seems that the Centipede 
POS system can't talk to HQ anymore either. I know that 
the router crashed last night and had to be restarted. 
I'm wondering if the last working configuration wasn't 
saved. Regardless of why, we need to get this fixed 
ASAP as we are quickly receiving complaints from the 
store staff about not being able to complete transactions."

Jacqueline Smith:
"Please fix this quickly as both staff and customers are 
beginning to get really upset."

## Recon

I established that **Edge-Router1** *(Centipede-Router) 172.31.2.4*, and **Edge-Router2** *(Asteroids-Router) 172.31.2.4* lost connectivity to the **pfsense firewall** *172.31.2.2*, and the **MSP** *172.31.2.5*.  My first order of business was to learn more about the Edge Router.  I connected to *172.31.2.4* and ran the following:

```shell

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ uname -a

Linux Edge-Router1 3.13.11-1-amd64-vyos #1 SMP Wed Aug 12 02:08:05 UTC 2015 x86_64 GNU/Linux

```

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n1ghtx0w1/WriteUps/main/NICE-Challenges/nice-3/img/edge-router.png" alt="router" width="600" height="300">

From this, I, was able to do some research:

- https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/204960094-EdgeRouter-Configuration-and-Operational-Mode

- https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/cli.html

## Connect and Configure

From **Edge-Router1**, I wanted to re-establish the connection to the **firewall**, and **MSP**.  I did the following:

```shell

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ show vpn debug detail | grep left

     left=172.31.2.3

     leftsubnet=192.168.10.0/24

     leftsourceip=172.31.2.3

     left=172..31.2.3

     leftsubnet=192.168.10.0/24

     leftsoruceip=172.31.2.3

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ configure

[edit]

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ vpn ipsec site-to-site

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ set peer 172.31.2.2 tunnel 1 local prefix 192.168.10.0/24

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ set peer 172.31.2.5 tunnel 1 local prefix 192.168.10.0/24

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ commit

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router1:~$ save

Saving configuration to `/config/config.boot`...

Done

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

```

---

Essentially re-establishing the connection between the **Edge-Router1** *(Centipede-Router)*, **Firewall**, and External **MSP** through **ipsec vpn peer-to-peer configuration**.  I repeated these steps with **Edge-Router2** slightly different as observed below:

```shell

playerone@Edge-Router2:~$ show vpn debug detail | grep left

     left=172.31.2.4

     leftsubnet=192.168.10.0/24

     leftsourceip=172.31.2.4

     left=172..31.2.4

     leftsubnet=192.168.10.0/24

     leftsoruceip=172.31.2.4

playerone@Edge-Router2:~$ configure

[edit]

playerone@Edge-Router2:~$ vpn ipsec site-to-site

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router2:~$ set peer 172.31.2.2 tunnel 1 local prefix 192.168.10.0/24

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router2:~$ set peer 172.31.2.5 tunnel 1 local prefix 192.168.10.0/24

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router2:~$ commit

[edit vpn ipsec site-to-site]

playerone@Edge-Router2:~$ save

Saving configuration to `/config/config

```

Thus re-establishing the connection between the **Edge-Router2** *(Asteroids-Router)*, the **pfsense firewall**, and External **MSP** through ipsec vpn peer-to-peer configuration.

## Conclusion

MSP to Centipede POS Health Check Desired State Status = **"Passing"** at 02:41 PM PST

Each NICE Challenge has the following core elements: a narrative-driven scenario, a business environment (workspace), and a set of technical objectives and/or a written deliverable. Each of these elements is developed to immerse the player (student) in a real-world experience and create a valuable set of data allowing their curator (educator) to judge their readiness for the workforce.
