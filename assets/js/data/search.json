The OSI model is a fundamental concept in the world of networking, providing a systematic approach to understanding how different networking protocols communicate with each other. Understanding the OSI model in the context of layer-specific attacks can make the learning process even more engaging and practical. Let’s go through some layer-specific attacks, their implications, and strategies to mitigate them.1. Physical Layer and Wiretapping AttackFirst layer in the OSI model is the physical layer. The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual transmission of raw data over a physical medium, such as cables, fiber optics, or wireless channels. Its primary role is to establish and maintain a physical connection between network devices and ensure that bits are transmitted and received accurately. At this layer, data is represented as electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves, depending on the medium used for communication. The physical layer is concerned with various aspects of data transmission, including the type of cable or medium, the voltage levels used to represent 0s and 1s, the physical connectors and pins, the timing of data transmission, and the physical topology of the network.The physical layer is responsible for converting the digital bits from higher-layer protocols into a suitable physical format for transmission over the network medium. It also handles tasks like signal modulation, encoding, and error detection to ensure reliable data delivery. The physical layer deals with issues related to signal attenuation, interference, and noise that may affect data integrity during transmission. The successful functioning of higher OSI layers heavily depends on the reliability and efficiency of the physical layer, as any flaws at this level can lead to data loss or corruption.How Wiretapping Attacks are PerformedWiretapping attacks involve attackers gaining unauthorized access to the physical medium used for data transmission, such as network cables or communication lines, to intercept and eavesdrop on the communication between network devices. Attackers can use various techniques to perform these attacks, including tapping directly into the cables, using special devices to intercept electromagnetic signals, or placing covert listening devices along the communication path. By doing so, attackers can capture sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, or confidential communications, passing through the compromised physical connection. Physical layer wiretapping attacks are particularly challenging to detect and prevent, as they do not typically leave digital traces and require physical access to the network infrastructure.Mitigating Wiretapping AttacksImplementing strong physical security is crucial to mitigating wiretapping attacks. This includes restricting access to critical network infrastructure, securing network closets and data centers, and using tamper-evident seals to detect unauthorized access. Regular inspections of communication lines and cables for signs of tampering are essential to identify potential threats promptly. Employing encryption technologies, such as VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) or TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensures that even if attackers intercept data, it remains encrypted and unreadable to them. Using advanced intrusion detection systems that can detect anomalies in network traffic patterns can also help in identifying potential wiretapping activities. A layered security approach that combines physical security, encryption, and intrusion detection is the most effective way to mitigate physical layer wiretapping attacks and safeguard sensitive data from physical layer attacks.2. Data Link and VLAN Hopping AttackSecond layer is the data link layer. The data link layer is situated above the physical layer and below the network layer. Its primary purpose is to provide a reliable and error-free data transmission between two directly connected nodes in a local area network (LAN) or point-to-point communication link. The data link layer breaks the data received from the network layer into frames and adds necessary header and trailer information, including source and destination MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, frame sequence numbers, and error-checking information (such as cyclic redundancy check, CRC). This layer ensures that data packets are correctly delivered to their intended recipients and retransmits any lost or corrupted frames, enhancing the overall reliability of data transmission.The data link layer is also responsible for managing access to the shared communication medium when multiple devices are connected to the same network segment. It uses Media Access Control (MAC) protocols to govern how devices on the network contend for access to the transmission medium, avoiding data collisions and ensuring fair usage of the network bandwidth. One common MAC protocol is CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) used in Ethernet networks. In point-to-point communication, the data link layer establishes and terminates connections between the two nodes using protocols like PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol). The data link layer plays a critical role in enabling reliable and efficient data communication within a local network and facilitating error detection and correction mechanisms to maintain data integrity.How VLAN Hopping Attacks are PerformedAttackers exploit vulnerabilities in network switch configurations to gain unauthorized access to different VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks). One common technique involves sending forged or manipulated frames with 802.1Q tags, which are used to identify VLAN membership. By altering these tags, attackers can trick the switch into believing that the frames belong to a different VLAN than their original one, allowing them to traverse between VLANs and potentially access sensitive information or exploit resources in other segments. Attackers can also use double-tagging or Q-in-Q attacks, where they add multiple VLAN tags to the frames, confusing the switch and potentially gaining access to unintended VLANs.Mitigating VLAN Hopping AttacksNetwork administrators should configure switches to disable unused ports or put them in an inactive state to minimize potential attack vectors. Enabling port security features, such as MAC address filtering or dynamic ARP inspection, helps prevent MAC spoofing and address resolution protocol (ARP) attacks that attackers might use to gain unauthorized access. Implementing VLAN pruning ensures that frames are only forwarded to the appropriate VLANs, limiting the potential for VLAN hopping. Utilizing techniques like Private VLANs can isolate sensitive devices within a VLAN, preventing communication between them and other devices on the same VLAN.3. Network Layer and Ping Sweep AttackThe network layer is responsible for routing data across different networks. Its main purpose is to manage network traffic, determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination, and facilitate communication between devices in separate networks. The network layer receives data from the transport layer above it and encapsulates it into packets, adding the source and destination IP addresses to each packet. These IP addresses enable routers in the network to make intelligent decisions on how to forward the packets towards their destination. Routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), are used by routers to exchange routing information and build a routing table that helps guide data to its intended destination. The network layer ensures that data packets can traverse complex networks with multiple routers and links, allowing for efficient and reliable data transmission across interconnected networks.This layer shields the upper layers from the complexities of the underlying physical and data link layers and provides logical addressing through IP addresses, making global communication possible. It enables the implementation of various network services, such as network segmentation, subnetting, and network address translation (NAT), to optimize network performance, conserve IP address space, and enhance security. By providing routing capabilities and addressing services, the network layer plays a pivotal role in enabling data to flow smoothly and efficiently across diverse networks.How Ping Sweep Attacks are PerformedAttackers attempt to identify active hosts within a target network by sending ICMP echo requests (ping) to a range of IP addresses. The attackers systematically send these ping packets to a large number of IP addresses within a specific network or IP address range, sequentially or using automated tools. If a host responds to the ICMP echo request, it indicates that the host is active and reachable, revealing potential targets for further attacks. By identifying active hosts through ping sweeps, attackers can gain valuable information about the network’s structure, discover potential vulnerabilities, and plan subsequent targeted attacks against specific systems or devices within the network.Mitigating Ping Sweep AttacksNetwork administrators can configure firewalls or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict or block ICMP traffic, particularly ICMP echo requests, from external or unauthorized sources. By limiting the exposure of the network to such probing, attackers’ ability to perform ping sweeps is significantly reduced. Deploying intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) can help detect and respond to ping sweep attempts in real-time, allowing administrators to take appropriate actions promptly. Regular monitoring of network traffic and analyzing log data can also aid in identifying and mitigating suspicious activities, including ping sweeps.4. Transport Layer and Port Scanning AttackThe fourth layer in the OSI model is the transport layer. Its primary function is to provide communication between applications running on different devices. The transport layer achieves this through two main protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP ensures reliable data delivery by establishing a connection-oriented communication channel. It performs segmentation of data received from the application layer into smaller packets, adds sequence numbers to these packets, and manages the reassembly and acknowledgment of received packets to guarantee that data is transmitted without loss or corruption. UDP, on the other hand, offers a connectionless, lightweight communication option, suitable for applications where low overhead and quick data transfer are more important than reliability. The transport layer manages the flow control, congestion control, and error correction mechanisms, optimizing data delivery while adapting to varying network conditions.The transport layer also supports port numbers to uniquely identify specific applications on a device. These port numbers, in combination with IP addresses, allow data to be correctly routed to the appropriate application running on the destination device. Additionally, the transport layer provides multiplexing and demultiplexing functions, enabling multiple applications on the same device to share the network connection.How Port Scanning Attacks are PerformedPort scanning attacks are performed when attackers systematically probe a target network or host to identify open ports and services available on the system. They do this by sending network packets to various port numbers and analyzing the responses to determine which ports are open and actively listening for connections. Attackers use different scanning techniques, such as TCP SYN scans, TCP connect scans, UDP scans, and FIN scans, to elicit different responses from the target’s ports and infer their status. By discovering open ports, attackers gain insight into potential entry points for exploiting vulnerabilities, launching further attacks, or identifying active services that could be potential targets for exploitation. Port scanning is a common reconnaissance technique used by attackers to gather information about a target’s network architecture and identify potential weaknesses.Mitigating Port Scanning AttacksImplementing firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) can restrict access to specific ports, blocking unauthorized scanning attempts. Network administrators should also regularly monitor network traffic and look for patterns indicative of port scanning activities. Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) can be used to detect and respond to scanning attempts in real-time, triggering alerts or automated countermeasures. Employing port security tools, like port knocking or port randomization, can further make it difficult for attackers to identify open ports. Regularly patching and updating systems and applications helps eliminate known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit during scanning.5. Session Layer and RPC AttackThe session layer’s primary purpose is to establish, manage, and terminate sessions or connections between applications running on different devices. The session layer ensures that data exchange between applications remains synchronized and reliable, providing mechanisms for session establishment, synchronization, and checkpointing. It facilitates session management functions like session establishment, maintenance, and termination. When two applications want to communicate, the session layer establishes a session and assigns a unique identifier to the connection, allowing the data to be exchanged in an orderly manner. If the session is interrupted or needs to be resumed later, the session layer supports checkpointing, allowing data to be saved and resumed from a specific point. In the event of communication errors or failures, the session layer provides mechanisms to recover or reestablish the session to maintain a continuous flow of data.This layer is responsible for managing session security by implementing features like authentication, authorization, and encryption. It ensures that only authorized users or applications can establish sessions and access data, enhancing overall network security. Additionally, the session layer can manage multiple simultaneous sessions, allowing applications to maintain separate communication streams and switch between them efficiently. By providing these session management services, the session layer simplifies the communication process for applications and fosters reliable and secure data exchange.How RPC Attacks are PerformedRPC (Remote Procedure Call) attacks happen when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the remote procedure call mechanism to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code on a remote system. RPC is a protocol that allows programs running on different devices to communicate and request services from each other over a network. Attackers target these RPC mechanisms to inject crafted or malicious data into the communication stream, leading to various types of attacks. For instance, attackers can perform RPC injection attacks by sending manipulated data that tricks the remote system into executing unintended commands or functions. They can also engage in session hijacking, where they intercept and take over an established RPC session to impersonate legitimate users or applications, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information or services. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the session layer RPC, attackers can potentially compromise the security and integrity of remote communications and systems.Mitigating RPC AttacksIt is important to implement strong authentication and access controls to ensure that only authorized users or applications can initiate RPC sessions. Employing encryption mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS, can safeguard the communication channel and protect sensitive data from interception or tampering. Regularly updating and patching the RPC software and underlying systems help address known vulnerabilities. Input validation and output encoding should be applied to prevent RPC injection attacks and other forms of data manipulation. Implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems can aid in detecting and responding to suspicious RPC activities, ensuring timely mitigation of potential threats.6. Presentation Layer and Man-in-the-Middle AttackThe presentation ensures that data is exchanged between applications in a format that is mutually understandable and independent of the underlying network or data representation. The sixth layer takes care of data formatting, translation, and encryption to facilitate seamless communication between different systems with varying data formats. It is responsible for data compression to reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network, optimizing network bandwidth and improving overall performance. The presentation layer handles data encryption and decryption, providing confidentiality and security during data transmission. It also handles data transformation, converting data from one representation (such as ASCII) to another (such as Unicode) to ensure that applications on different systems can interpret the data correctly.Presentation layer manages data syntax and semantics, ensuring that data is accurately interpreted by the receiving application. It deals with endianness issues, which are differences in the byte order of data representation in different computer architectures. The presentation layer also handles character encoding and decoding, necessary for supporting multilingual data exchange. By providing these services, the presentation layer abstracts the complexities of data representation from the application layer, simplifying the development of applications and fostering interoperability between different systems with diverse data formats and architectures.How Man-in-the-Middle Attacks are PerformedMan-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks occur when attackers intercept and manipulate data exchanged between applications or systems to eavesdrop on communication or alter the content. The attacker positions themselves between the communicating parties, impersonating both the sender and the receiver, making them the intermediary for data transmission. When data is sent from the sender, the attacker captures it, makes changes as desired, and then forwards the modified data to the intended receiver, while also impersonating the receiver to the original sender. This allows the attacker to monitor sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, or confidential communications, and potentially gain unauthorized access to secure systems. Presentation layer MITM attacks can be particularly insidious as they allow attackers to modify the content being exchanged, leading to data corruption, unauthorized access, or deception of both communicating parties.Mitigating Man-in-the-Middle AttacksEmploying secure communication protocols such as SSL/TLS ensures data encryption and authentication, making it difficult for attackers to intercept or tamper with data in transit. Verifying the authenticity of communication partners through digital certificates helps prevent attackers from impersonating legitimate entities. Implementing strong endpoint security measures, such as antivirus and intrusion detection systems, can help detect and respond to potential MITM attacks. Additionally, educating users about the risks of MITM attacks and promoting secure communication practices, like using VPNs when accessing public networks, helps reduce the likelihood of falling victim to such attacks.7. Application Layer and SQL Injection AttackThe application layer is responsible for providing a platform for end-user applications to interact with the network and exchange data. It serves as the interface between the user and the underlying network services, enabling various applications to access network resources and communicate with remote systems. The application layer supports a wide range of services and protocols tailored to specific applications, including web browsing (HTTP), email communication (SMTP, POP3, IMAP), file transfer (FTP), and domain name resolution (DNS), among others. Each application protocol defines the rules and conventions for data exchange, ensuring that the data is accurately formatted and interpreted on both the sending and receiving sides. This layer abstracts the complexities of lower OSI layers, allowing developers to focus on creating applications without worrying about network intricacies.The seventh layer enables the implementation of sophisticated network services and functionalities, such as data compression, encryption, and authentication. It handles data formatting and presentation to ensure that information is presented in a readable and user-friendly manner. Additionally, the application layer supports user authentication and access control mechanisms, providing security and privacy features to restrict access to sensitive resources. The versatility and variety of services offered by the application layer make it an essential component of the OSI model, enabling a wide range of applications to seamlessly and securely communicate over the network.How SQL Injection Attacks are PerformedSQL injection attacks can occur when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that do not properly validate or sanitize user input. They insert malicious SQL code into input fields, such as search boxes or login forms, with the intention of manipulating the application’s database. When the application processes the input, the malicious SQL code is executed, allowing the attacker to extract, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database. In worst-case scenarios, SQL injection attacks can lead to unauthorized access to the entire database or even the compromise of the entire web server.Mitigating SQL Injection AttacksDevelopers should implement proper input validation and sanitize user input by filtering out potentially harmful characters. Parameterized queries or prepared statements should be used to ensure that user-supplied data is treated as data rather than executable code. Implementing least privilege access controls for database users limits the damage an attacker can cause if a successful SQL injection occurs. Regular security assessments and code reviews can help identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in the application code. Deploying web application firewalls (WAFs) can help detect and block SQL injection attempts in real-time.ConclusionI found it a lot easier to remember the different layers in the OSI model by understanding how they can be exploited, and what mitigation steps can be taken to protect each layer." }, { "title": "AVrecon Malware - SOHO Botnet", "url": "/posts/avrecon/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "AVrecon Malware SOHO Botnet, A Stealthy Network of Malicious Intent, Attack Chain, The Exploitation of Vulnerable Infrastructure, Dual Objective Advertising Fraud and Data Exfiltration, ZuoRAT, HiatusRAT, Ye Seth Jin, Kaspersky labs, Lumen Black Lotus Labs", "date": "2023-07-16 18:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Senior security researcher Ye (Seth) Jin, from Kaspersky Labs, first tweeted about AVrecon in May of 2021. This sophisticated malware has now successfully infiltrated more than 70,000 devices, creating a massive botnet with 40,000 nodes spread across 20 countries. The emergence of AVrecon marks the third such strain targeting SOHO routers, following the tracks of ZuoRAT and HiatusRAT in the past year.A Stealthy Network of Malicious IntentLumen Black Lotus Labs has labeled AVrecon as one of the largest botnets designed to target SOHO routers. According to Lumen Black Lotus Labs, this malicious campaign aims to establish a covert network, enabling a wide range of criminal activities including password spraying and digital advertising fraud. The sheer scale of infections is primarily concentrated in the United Kingdom and the United States, with notable presence in countries such as Argentina, Nigeria, Brazil, Italy, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Russia, and South Africa.Attack ChainLumen Black Lotus Labs has provided insights into the attack chain employed by AVrecon. The initial phase involves infecting a target system and extracting relevant information/data about the victim’s SOHO router. That information/data is then transmitted back to an embedded command-and-control (C2) server. To ensure the system isn’t compromised by other malware strains, AVrecon searches for existing processes on port 48102 and terminates any process bound to that port. Once infected, the compromised system establishes communication with a separate server, known as the secondary C2 server, awaiting further commands. Researchers have identified 15 unique servers that have been active since at least October 2021. This is indicative a sophisticated infrastructure supporting the botnet’s operations.The Exploitation of Vulnerable InfrastructureAVrecon, written in C, possesses the capability to be easily adapted for different system architectures. These attacks exploit the inherent vulnerabilities of edge infrastructure, which often lacks robust security solutions. This factor contributes significantly to the success of AVrecon and similar threats.Dual Objective: Advertising Fraud and Data ExfiltrationEvidence gathered suggests that AVrecon serves a dual purpose. The malware is involved in clicking on various Facebook and Google ads, while also interacting with Microsoft Outlook. This indicates a two-pronged effort to engage in advertising fraud and data exfiltration. The attackers establish a residential proxy service to facilitate the laundering of malicious activities by covertly stealing bandwidth without impacting end-users. This strategy allows them to avoid drawing attention from Tor-hidden services and commercially available VPN services.ConclusionAVrecon poses a threat to small office/home office (SOHO) routers worldwide. As the malware targets vulnerable edge infrastructure, it is important for individuals and businesses to prioritize security solutions that safeguard against such sophisticated threats. The discovery of AVrecon serves as a wake-up call, emphasizing the ongoing battle between cybercriminals and cybersecurity experts to protect digital ecosystems." }, { "title": "Evil Portals &amp; Evil Twin Wi-Fi Hacking", "url": "/posts/evil-portals/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "Evil Portals & Evil Twin Wi-Fi Hacking, Understanding Evil Portals, The Evil Twin, PhishPi, Flipper Zero Evil Portal WiFi AP, Tools of the Trade, Aircrack-NG, HAK5 Wifi Pineapple", "date": "2023-07-05 08:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Hackers make use of various techniques to infiltrate networks and compromise unsuspecting victims. Among these techniques; evil portals, and evil twin Wi-Fi attacks have gained notoriety for their deceptive tactics. I’m going to briefly explain these hacking methods and shed light on some of the tools employed by red teamers and hackers to exploit them.Active PortalsActive portals, also known as captive portals, are a type of network authentication mechanism commonly used in public Wi-Fi networks, such as those found in hotels, airports, or coffee shops. When a user connects to an active portal network, they are redirected to a login or registration page before gaining full access to the internet. These portals serve as a means for network administrators to control and manage user access, enforce terms of service agreements, or collect user information for marketing purposes. However, active portals can also be exploited by malicious actors who create deceptive login pages to trick users into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. Therefore, it is crucial for users to exercise caution when using active portal networks and ensure that the portal page they interact with is legitimate and secure to avoid falling victim to phishing attacks or data breaches.Understanding Evil PortalsEvil Portals, also referred to as rogue portals, are malicious Wi-Fi networks created with the intention of deceiving and exploiting unsuspecting users. These portals imitate legitimate Wi-Fi hotspots, making them appear trustworthy to users seeking to connect to the internet. Once a user connects to an Evil Portal, they are redirected to a spoofed login page that resembles a familiar website or service, such as a social media platform or online banking portal. The user is then prompted to enter their login credentials or other sensitive information, which is captured by the attacker.The purpose of Evil Portals is to harvest user data, including usernames, passwords, credit card information, and other personal details, for malicious purposes such as identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to accounts. Hackers employ various techniques and tools to create convincing portal pages that closely resemble the legitimate sites they imitate, increasing the likelihood of users unknowingly divulging their information.The Evil TwinEvil Twin Wi-Fi attacks involve the creation of a fraudulent wireless network that closely resembles a legitimate one. By mimicking the name (SSID) and other characteristics of a trusted network, the attacker tricks unsuspecting users into connecting to the malicious network instead. Once connected, the attacker can intercept and manipulate the victim’s internet traffic, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, or personal details.To execute an Evil Twin attack, hackers use specialized tools that allow them to create an exact replica of the target network. These tools enable the attacker to monitor all communication between the victim’s device and the internet, making it easy to eavesdrop, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or inject malicious content. Evil Twin attacks exploit the inherent trust that users place in Wi-Fi networks, as most people assume that networks with familiar names are safe to connect to.PhishPiPhishPi is a powerful tool widely used by red teamers and ethical hackers for executing captive portal attacks and cloning websites. Based on a Raspberry Pi, PhishPi allows hackers to set up Evil Portals with ease. Its customizable features and user-friendly interface make it a popular choice for performing simulated attacks, helping organizations identify vulnerabilities in their Wi-Fi networks and raise awareness about the risks of falling victim to Evil Portals.Home-Grown-Red-TeamFlipper Zero Evil Portal WiFi APFlipper Zero Evil Portal is another noteworthy tool used in Wi-Fi hacking. Built specifically for Flipper Zero devices, it simplifies the process of setting up Evil Twin attacks. By emulating a target Wi-Fi network, Flipper Zero Evil Portal can lure unsuspecting users into connecting, granting the attacker access to their sensitive information.This project turns a Wi-Fi dev board into an open access point. When users try to connect to this access point they will be served a fake login screen. User credentials are sent to the Flipper and logged into an SD card. This tool is also deployed to help red teamers understand how victims fall prey to simulated attacks.Flipper Zero Evil PortalTools of the TradeRed teamers and hackers employ a range of tools to execute evil portal and evil twin attacks. Other widely used tools by red teamers and hackers include Wi-Fi Pineapple, a versatile platform for wireless penetration testing, and Aircrack-ng, a powerful suite of tools for Wi-Fi network auditing and cracking.HAK5 WiFi PineappleAircrack-NGConclusionEvil portals and evil twin Wi-Fi hacking presents are threats to individuals, organizations, and their sensitive data. As cyber threats continue to evolve, it is crucial for security professionals and individuals alike to stay informed about these techniques and the tools employed by hackers. By understanding the risks associated with these attacks, adopting robust security measures, and promoting awareness, we can fortify ourselves against the shadowy world of Wi-Fi hacking and ensure a safer digital landscape.Exercise caution when connecting to Wi-Fi networks, especially in public places, to avoid falling victim to these deceptive practices. Verifying the authenticity of Wi-Fi networks, ensuring the presence of secure connections (HTTPS), and using virtual private networks (VPNs) can help mitigate the risks associated with Evil Portals and safeguard sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands." }, { "title": "MITRE Most Dangerous Software Weakness 2023", "url": "/posts/mitre-list/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "MITRE, Analyzing Vulnerability Data, Top 10 MITRE Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses, Significance of Out-of-bounds Write, Importance of Vulnerability Data Analysis, Hardware Weaknesses and Prevention, Recommendations for Hardening CI/CD Environments, Mitigating Exploitation Vectors, Concerns about Publicly Accessible Remote Management Interfaces", "date": "2023-07-02 19:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "MITRE has recently unveiled its annual compilation of the Top 25 “most dangerous software weaknesses” for the year 2023.

As a result, various cyber authorities, threat hunters, and security researchers are actively investigating and monitoring for potential new victims.Anticipating Widespread ExploitationA joint advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI, issued on June 7, warns that based on TA505’s past campaigns and the speed at which they exploited this vulnerability, widespread exploitation of unpatched software services in both private and public networks is anticipated.Impact on High-Profile OrganizationsHigh-profile organizations such as British Airways and the BBC have come forward as victims of the follow-on attack, affecting at least eight Zellis customers. British Airways is currently notifying employees affected by the compromise of their PII, while the BBC is conducting an investigation to determine the extent of the breach. The government of Nova Scotia, which also uses MOVEit, discovered that residents’ PII was compromised.Extent of Affected UsersWhile the exact number of companies currently using MOVEit and the total count of victims have not been disclosed by Progress, the company has hundreds of thousands of customers, including 1,700 software companies and 3.5 million developers, as reported in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Patching and Vulnerability DetailsProgress publicly disclosed the zero-day vulnerability on May 31, identifying it as CVE-2023-34362 on June 2. The vulnerability affects both on-premises and cloud-based versions of MOVEit. Promptly, Progress released patches for on-premises versions and applied fixes to cloud test servers on June 1. Third-party validations have been conducted to ensure the effectiveness of the patch.NIST: NVDBase Score: 9.8 CRITICALVector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:HNIST - CVE-2023-34362 DetailsOngoing Investigation and CollaborationMultiple entities, including CISA, CrowdStrike, Mandiant, Microsoft, Huntress, and Rapid7, are collaborating with Progress in incident response and ongoing investigations to mitigate the effects of the attacks.Previous Exploits and AttributionThis incident marks the third high-profile zero-day vulnerability linked to a file-transfer service this year. Clop, the group behind the attacks, has also exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Fortra’s GoAnywhere file-transfer service in March and conducted a zero-day exploit-driven campaign against Accellion file transfer devices in 2020 and 2021. While researchers have differing opinions on the attribution of these attacks, indications point to Clop ransomware or its affiliates. Mandiant has identified a new threat cluster called UNC4857 (now merged into FIN11), known for exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in file transfer systems. Microsoft attributes the attacks to Clop, specifically identifying the group as Lace Tempest under its threat actor naming system. Huntress has provided evidence suggesting that the web shell indicator of compromise shared by Progress and security researchers is not essential for compromising the MOVEit software.BleepingComputer: Fortra shares findings on GoAnywhere MFT zero-day attacksNIST - CVE-2023-0669 DetailsMandiant: Zero-Day Vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer Exploited for Data TheftMicrosoft: How Microsoft names threat actorsPatching Additional VulnerabilitiesProgress has acknowledged the findings and released a patch for additional vulnerabilities discovered by Huntress. The investigation is ongoing, and there is currently no indication of exploitation of these newly discovered vulnerabilities. However, the potential for other attacks or consequences exists due to the identified arbitrary code execution attack vector.Significance of Exploited VulnerabilitiesThe recent attacks on MOVEit and its customers highlight the significance of exploited vulnerabilities as the primary cause of ransomware incidents. John Shier, field CTO at Sophos, emphasizes the importance of addressing vulnerabilities promptly to prevent such incidents in the future.Additional References:Progress MOVEit Community ArticleJohn Hammond YT - MOVEit Transfer Exploitation (my API presentation recording)┌──(root㉿servver)-[~] └─$ cat howtocybersecurity.txt- ## unplug the internet- " }, { "title": "Prioritize Cyber Security", "url": "/posts/cyber-plan/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "have a plan, be prepared for cyber incidents, cybersecurity, cyber, security, risk assessment, analysis, security policy, security awareness, access management, user controls, incident response planning, major incident management, threat detection, vulnerability management, continuous improvement and evaluation", "date": "2023-06-30 09:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Having a Security PostureIn today’s digital landscape, where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, organizations must prioritize their cyber security efforts.

Prioritizing cybersecurity is an investment that pays dividends in protecting against cyber threats and maintaining a resilient and secure environment.There are several cybersecurity frameworks that organizations can use to develop a plan for addressing cyber threats. These frameworks provide guidelines, best practices, and standards to help organizations manage their cybersecurity risks effectively. I’d like to just breifly touch on a few of these:NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF): Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the CSF provides a comprehensive approach to managing and reducing cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. NISTISO 27001: This is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach for managing sensitive information and addresses security risks in a structured manner. ISO 27001CIS Controls: The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls is a set of best practices designed to help organizations safeguard their systems and data. The controls provide a prioritized framework for mitigating the most common cyber threats. CIS ControlsCOBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies): COBIT is a framework developed by ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) for IT governance and management. It focuses on aligning IT activities with business objectives and includes guidance on managing cybersecurity risks. COBITHITRUST Common Security Framework: The HITRUST Common Security Framework includes risk analysis and risk management frameworks, along with operational requirements. The framework has 14 different control categories and can be applied to almost any organization, including healthcare. HITRUSTMITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK: MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK is a knowledge base that describes common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries during cyber attacks. It can help organizations understand and prepare for potential threats. MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CKThese frameworks can be tailored to an organization’s specific needs and industry requirements. These frameworks provide guidelines, best practices, and standards to help manage cybersecurity risks effectively. The choice of framework will depend on factors such as the organization’s size, resources, industry regulations, and specific compliance requirements.┌──(root㉿servver)-[~] └─$ vi cyberplan.txt- ## Get Started- " }, { "title": "CJIS Compliance &amp; Audits", "url": "/posts/cjis/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, cjis, criminal justice information systems, compliance, audits, law enforcement data, federal bureau of investigation criminal justice information, department of justice, criminal justice statistics", "date": "2023-03-17 01:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "What is CJISCriminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) is a division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that provides a range of criminal justice information services to law enforcement agencies in the United States. The CJIS Division maintains criminal justice databases and is responsible for setting and enforcing security policies and requirements for organizations that handle and maintain criminal justice information. CJIS compliance is mandatory for organizations that handle criminal justice information and failure to comply can result in penalties and loss of access to criminal justice information.CJIS ComplianceCJIS compliance refers to an organization’s adherence to the security policies and requirements set forth by the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The CJIS Security Policy outlines a set of security requirements for organizations that handle and maintain criminal justice information, including law enforcement agencies, criminal justice agencies, and private sector partners.To achieve CJIS compliance, organizations must implement appropriate security measures to protect criminal justice information from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. This includes implementing physical security measures, such as access controls and monitoring systems, as well as technical security measures, such as encryption and firewalls.Organizations that are required to be compliant must also ensure that their personnel are properly trained on the security policies and procedures outlined in the CJIS Security Policy. This includes regular training on the proper handling and protection of criminal justice information, as well as ongoing awareness campaigns to promote good security practices.It’s mandatory for organizations that handle criminal justice information, and failure to comply can result in penalties and loss of access to criminal justice information. The CJIS Division regularly conducts audits of organizations to ensure compliance with the CJIS Security Policy, and organizations that fail to meet the requirements may be subject to corrective action or loss of access to criminal justice information.CJIS AuditsAs part of its mission, CJIS conducts audits of organizations that handle and maintain criminal justice information to ensure compliance with the CJIS Security Policy.A CJIS audit is a comprehensive review of an organization’s policies, procedures, and security measures related to the handling, storage, and transmission of criminal justice information. The purpose of the audit is to ensure that organizations are taking appropriate measures to protect criminal justice information from unauthorized access or disclosure, which could compromise ongoing investigations or endanger public safety.During an audit, an auditor from the FBI’s CJIS Division will conduct a thorough review of the organization’s security program, including policies, procedures, and training materials. The auditor will assess the organization’s understanding and adherence to these policies and procedures, as well as conduct interviews with key personnel to gain insight into the organization’s security practices.The auditor will also conduct a physical security assessment of the organization’s facilities, including data centers and storage areas, to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect criminal justice information from unauthorized access or theft. This may include reviewing security cameras, access control systems, and other security measures.Additionally, the auditor will review the organization’s IT systems and infrastructure to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place to protect against unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of criminal justice information. This may include reviewing network security controls, system access controls, and data encryption practices.Once the audit is complete, the auditor will provide the organization with a report of their findings, including any deficiencies or areas for improvement. The organization will then have an opportunity to address any identified issues and implement corrective actions to address any deficiencies before the next audit.By conducting regular audits of organizations that handle this sensitive information, the FBI’s CJIS Division is able to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or theft. This, in turn, helps to promote public safety and ensure the integrity of the criminal justice system.ConclusionBy adhering to the security requirements outlined in the CJIS Security Policy, organizations can help to ensure that criminal justice information remains protected from unauthorized access or disclosure, and that the criminal justice system remains effective in promoting public safety.Additional Training Information:CJIS Online - Secuirty Awareness TrainingQuizlet - CJIS Security Test FlashcardsTraining is also done in person at organizations through various vendors.┌──(root㉿servver)-[~] └─$ lscjis_training_material" }, { "title": "Threat Detection and Response Systems (IDR, EDR, and XDR)", "url": "/posts/idredrxdr/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, idr, Incident Detection and Response, edr, Endpoint Detection and Response, xdr, Extended Detection and Response, threat detection and response", "date": "2023-03-16 12:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "There are several terms that are used to describe different types of threat detection and response systems in cybersecurity. Among these, IDR, EDR, and XDR are three terms that are frequently used. While they may seem similar at first glance, there are significant differences between them that are important to understand. Now let’s discuss the differences between IDR, EDR, and XDR.IDRIDR (Incident Detection and Response) or attack threat detection and response, refers to a set of tools and techniques that are used to detect and respond to security incidents. These tools typically include intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and other similar technologies. IDR systems are designed to identify potential security breaches and alert security teams so that they can take appropriate action.Read more about IDR here: Rapid7 - What is Incident Detection and Response?EDREDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) is a type of security technology that focuses on detecting and responding to threats that originate from endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. EDR systems are typically deployed on these endpoints and monitor them for suspicious activity. They use advanced detection techniques, such as machine learning and behavioral analysis, to identify threats that traditional antivirus software may miss. When a threat is detected, the EDR system can take immediate action to quarantine or remediate the threat.Read more about EDR here: Crowdstrike - What is Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)?XDRXDR (Extended Detection and Response) is a relatively new term that has emerged in the cybersecurity industry. XDR is a comprehensive approach to threat detection and response that goes beyond traditional EDR systems. XDR solutions are designed to integrate data from multiple sources, including endpoints, network traffic, cloud services, and applications. By collecting and analyzing data from these sources, XDR solutions can provide a more complete picture of an organization’s security posture and detect threats that may be missed by other security tools. XDR also includes automated response capabilities that allow security teams to quickly respond to threats before they can cause significant damage.Read more about XDR here: Cisco - What Is Extended Detection and Response (XDR)?Key DifferencesWhile all three of these technologies are designed to help organizations detect and respond to security threats, there are some key differences between them. IDR focuses on detecting and responding to incidents across an organization’s entire infrastructure, while EDR is focused specifically on endpoint security. XDR takes a more holistic approach, integrating data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of an organization’s security posture. XDR also includes automated response capabilities that go beyond what is available in traditional IDR and EDR systems.ConclusionIDR, EDR, and XDR are all important technologies in the field of cybersecurity. While they share some similarities, they are designed to address different aspects of the security landscape. IDR is focused on incident detection and response across an organization’s entire infrastructure, EDR focuses on endpoint security, and XDR takes a comprehensive approach that integrates data from multiple sources to provide a more complete picture of an organization’s security posture. Understanding these differences is essential for organizations that want to develop a strong security strategy that can effectively detect and respond to threats.┌──(robert㉿kali)-[/opt/splunk] └─$ sudo dpkg -i splunk-6.3.1-linux-2.6-amd64.deb" }, { "title": "WannaCry Ransomware Attack", "url": "/posts/wannacry/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, hacking, marcus hutchins, wannacry, ransomware, killswitch, 2017 ransomware attack, eternalblue, nsa, DoublePulsar backdoor", "date": "2023-03-11 02:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack had a significant impact on organizations globally. The attack spread rapidly across different countries, infecting over 200,000 computers and causing significant disruptions to various industries. WannaCry is an example of the destructive and costly nature of cyber threats, making it essential to understand how it occurred, and how it could have been prevented. We will delve into the details of the WannaCry ransomware attack, its impact, response, and lessons learned. Examining this case study, we can gain insights into the importance of cyber-security and the need for organizations to take proactive measures to protect themselves from such threats.Impact of the AttackThe impact of the WannaCry was widespread, affecting both individuals and organizations globally. The attack caused disruptions in several industries, resulting in the shutdown of hospitals, transportation systems, and manufacturing plants, among others. The financial impact was estimated to be in the billions of dollars, with companies facing losses due to halted operations and lost data. The attack also highlighted the vulnerability of critical infrastructure, raising concerns about the potential for future attacks on essential services such as healthcare and transportation. Additionally, the attack eroded trust in the affected organizations, and many individuals were left feeling vulnerable and exposed. The WannaCry ransomware attack demonstrated the catastrophic consequences that cyber threats can have on organizations and the wider society.Why WannaCry Was so EffectiveThis ransomware attack was particularly effective for several reasons: Firstly, the attack targeted a vulnerability in the SMB protocol that was widely used and affected older versions of Microsoft Windows that had not been updated with the latest security patches. This made it easy for the attackers to infect machines that had not taken necessary security measures. Secondly, the ransomware used a worm-like functionality that allowed it to spread rapidly across networks and infect other machines connected to the infected computer. This feature made it easier for the attackers to propagate the ransomware and infect a large number of systems quickly. Thirdly, the attackers demanded payment in Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that is difficult to trace and has a high level of anonymity, making it easier for the attackers to collect the ransom and evade law enforcement. Finally, the attackers used social engineering tactics to lure victims into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links, exploiting the human element in cybersecurity. This attack combined technical vulnerabilities with social engineering tactics, allowing the attackers to propagate the ransomware quickly and widely and demand payment in a difficult-to-trace cryptocurrency.WannaCry OriginsWannaCry itself was developed using a tool called EternalBlue, which was leaked from the US National Security Agency (NSA). The attackers also used other tools and techniques, including the DoublePulsar backdoor, to exploit and gain access to vulnerable systems.Wired - The Leaked NSA Spy Tool That Hacked the WorldThe creators of WannaCry are not known for certain, but the attack was attributed to a group called Lazarus, which is believed to be based in North Korea. Lazarus has been linked to several high-profile attacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank in 2016.Trend Micro -A Look into the Lazarus Group’s OperationsThe Killswitch and Marcus HutchinsThis attack could have been much worse if not for the discovery of a hidden feature within the ransomware known as the “killswitch.” The killswitch was essentially a safety mechanism built into the ransomware, which allowed the attackers to stop the spread of the malware if they chose to do so.The killswitch was discovered by a young cybersecurity researcher named Marcus Hutchins, who was only 22 years old at the time. Hutchins was working from his bedroom in the UK when he noticed that the ransomware was attempting to connect to a specific domain name. He decided to register the domain name himself, which effectively acted as a killswitch and prevented the ransomware from spreading further.Hutchins’ discovery was a significant breakthrough in the fight against the WannaCry attack. Cybersecurity experts were able to use the killswitch to contain the spread of the ransomware and prevent further damage. Hutchins became an overnight hero in the cybersecurity community, with many praising him for his quick thinking and ingenuity.Wired - How an Accidental ‘Kill Switch’ Slowed Friday’s Massive Ransomware AttackLessons Learned from WannaCryThe WannaCry attack was one of the most widespread cyber attacks in history. The attack affected over 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, causing significant disruption to businesses, hospitals, and government agencies. The attack was a wake-up call for many organizations and individuals, highlighting the need for improved cybersecurity practices and awareness. In this article, we will discuss the key lessons learned from the WannaCry ransomware attack.Keeping software up to date One of the primary reasons why the WannaCry ransomware attack was so effective was that it exploited a vulnerability in the SMB protocol that had been patched by Microsoft several months before the attack. Organizations and individuals must ensure that their software is up to date and that they have applied the latest security patches to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited.Importance of backups Files on infected machines were encrypted, making it impossible to access them without the decryption key. Organizations and individuals should regularly back up their data to ensure that they can recover their data in the event of a ransomware attack.A need for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy WannaCry demonstrated the need for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that includes a combination of technical measures, such as firewalls and antivirus software, and non-technical measures, such as security awareness training for employees. It is essential to have a plan in place to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks.Dangers of relying on legacy systems WannaCry ransomware primarily affected older versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system that had not been updated with the latest security patches. Organizations should consider upgrading to newer systems that are less vulnerable to attacks. Relying on legacy systems can increase the risk of cyber attacks.Importance of collaboration This attack highlighted the need for collaboration between organizations, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity experts to prevent and respond to cyber threats. Collaboration can help organizations and individuals stay ahead of attackers and mitigate the impact of attacks when they occur.ConclusionWannaCry was a stark reminder of the importance of cybersecurity. Organizations and individuals must take steps to protect their systems and data from cyber attacks. By keeping software up to date, regularly backing up data, implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, upgrading legacy systems, and collaborating with others, we can reduce the risk of cyber attacks and mitigate their impact.┌──(robert㉿kali)-[~] └─$ cat wannacry.txtWhen infected you just wanna cry..." }, { "title": "OWASP TOP 10", "url": "/posts/owasptopten/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, web app security, owasp top 10, open web application security project, risks, vulnerabilities, broken access control, cryptographic failures, injection attacks, Insecure Design, Security Misconfiguration, Vulnerable and Outdated Components, Identification and Authentication Failures, Software and Data Integrity Failures, Security Logging and Monitoring Failures, Server-Side Request Forgery, SSRF, web application firewall, code sanitization, penetraion testing, bug bounty programs", "date": "2023-03-10 11:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)OWASP is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the security of software applications. It is an international organization that provides free resources and tools to help individuals and organizations understand and prevent software vulnerabilities.Founded in 2001, OWASP has since become a leading authority in application security. The organization is run by a group of volunteers who are passionate about promoting the importance of application security.OWASP has developed numerous resources that are freely available to the public, including educational materials, testing guides, and security tools. One of the most well-known resources provided by OWASP is the OWASP Top 10, a list of the most critical web application security risks.The organization also holds numerous conferences and training events around the world, bringing together security professionals, software developers, and other stakeholders to share knowledge and best practices.OWASP’s mission is to make application security “visible, so that individuals and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.” The organization believes that by promoting the importance of application security, it can help individuals and organizations to better protect their data and systems from cyber attacks.OWASP Top 10 2021: The Risks Associated With Each VulnerabilityA01-2021: Broken Access ControlBroken access controls are a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions within the application. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to steal sensitive information, modify data, or perform other malicious actions within the application.Common examples of broken access control include insecure direct object references, where an attacker is able to directly access and modify sensitive data without proper authorization, and insufficient authorization checks, where an attacker is able to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions by bypassing access control mechanisms.To prevent broken access control vulnerabilities, developers should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), to ensure that users are only able to access the data and perform the actions that they are authorized to do so.In addition, developers should use secure coding practices, such as input validation and output encoding, to prevent attackers from bypassing access control mechanisms through input manipulation or other methods.Regular testing and monitoring of access controls can also help to identify and prevent broken access control vulnerabilities. This includes conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and taking steps to address any identified issues.Broken access control vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the security of web applications, and developers and security professionals must take proactive steps to prevent these types of attacks by implementing proper security controls and best practices.OWASP - Broken Access ControlA02-2021: Cryptographic FailuresCryptographic failures are security vulnerabilities that arise from weaknesses or flaws in cryptographic algorithms or implementations. Cryptography is the practice of using mathematical algorithms to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information transmitted over a network or stored on a computer system. Cryptographic failures can occur when encryption keys are compromised, when algorithms are weak, or when cryptographic protocols are implemented incorrectly.Examples of cryptographic failures include: Weak encryption algorithms: Weak encryption algorithms such as DES or WEP are susceptible to brute-force attacks, which can allow an attacker to decrypt encrypted data. Key management failures: Cryptographic keys used for encryption and decryption are sensitive pieces of information that must be kept secure. Key management failures can occur when keys are not properly generated, stored, or destroyed. Protocol weaknesses: Cryptographic protocols such as SSL or TLS are designed to provide secure communication over a network. However, weaknesses in these protocols can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can allow an attacker to intercept and modify data in transit. Side-channel attacks: Cryptographic algorithms can sometimes leak information about the encrypted data through side-channels such as power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, or timing information. This can allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message from the ciphertext. Developers and security professionals must implement strong encryption algorithms and protocols that are resistant to attacks. They must also implement proper key management practices to ensure that cryptographic keys are generated, stored, and destroyed securely. Additionally, regular testing and monitoring of cryptographic implementations can help to identify and prevent potential vulnerabilities.Cryptographic failures can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other computer systems. By implementing strong encryption algorithms and protocols, properly managing cryptographic keys, and regularly testing and monitoring cryptographic implementations, organizations can reduce the risk of cryptographic failures and other security threats.OWASP - Cryptographic FailuresA03-2021: Injection AttacksInjection attacks are a type of security vulnerability that can have severe consequences if not properly addressed. Injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious code or input into an application, with the intention of manipulating the behavior of the application.The most common type of injection attack is a SQL injection, where an attacker injects SQL code into an input field of an application, such as a search bar or login field. The goal of an SQL injection attack is usually to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or to modify or delete data within the application’s database.Other types of injection attacks include LDAP injection, XPath injection, and OS command injection, where an attacker is able to manipulate the behavior of an application by injecting malicious input into fields that are used to execute LDAP, XPath or OS commands respectively.The consequences of an injection attack can be significant, including data theft, data loss or corruption, unauthorized access, and system compromise. The impact of these attacks can be especially severe for applications that process sensitive data, such as financial or healthcare applications.To prevent injection attacks, developers should use secure coding practices, such as input validation and parameterized queries, to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated. In addition, applications should be regularly tested for vulnerabilities, and any identified vulnerabilities should be promptly addressed.Injection attacks are a significant threat to the security of software applications, and developers and security professionals should take steps to mitigate the risk of these attacks by implementing proper security measures.OWASP - InjectionA04-2021: Insecure DesignInsecure design vulnerabilities refer to security weaknesses that arise from poor design decisions or flawed architecture in software systems. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to exploit flaws in the design of the system to gain unauthorized access to data or carry out other malicious activities.Insecure design vulnerabilities include: Lack of input validation: Applications that do not properly validate user input can be vulnerable to injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms: Applications that rely on weak authentication and authorization mechanisms can be vulnerable to attacks such as brute-force attacks or session hijacking. Inadequate error handling: Applications that do not properly handle errors can provide valuable information to attackers that can be used to carry out further attacks. Insufficient separation of privileges: Applications that do not separate privileges between different roles or users can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or carry out unauthorized actions. To prevent this vulnerability, developers and security professionals must follow secure design principles and best practices when designing software systems. This includes properly validating all user input, implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, and properly handling errors.Developers should conduct regular threat modeling exercises to identify potential vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security controls to mitigate them. This includes designing software systems with the principle of least privilege in mind, ensuring that privileges are separated between different roles and users.Insecure design vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By following secure design principles and best practices, regularly conducting threat modeling exercises, and implementing appropriate security controls, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of insecure design vulnerabilities and other security threats.OWASP - Insecure DesignA05-2021: Security MisconfigurationSecurity misconfigurations are a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application or system is not configured properly, leaving it open to attacks or other security risks. This vulnerability can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as default configurations, outdated software, or improper settings.Common examples of security misconfiguration include leaving default passwords or credentials in place, failing to apply security patches or updates to software, and leaving unnecessary services or ports open.To prevent security misconfiguration vulnerabilities, developers and system administrators should follow secure configuration practices, such as applying security updates and patches in a timely manner, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and disabling unnecessary services or ports.In addition, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can help to identify potential security misconfigurations and other vulnerabilities, allowing developers and administrators to take steps to address these issues before they can be exploited by attackers.Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the security of web applications and systems, and developers and security professionals must take proactive steps to prevent these types of attacks by implementing proper security controls and best practices. By following secure configuration practices and regularly testing and monitoring systems for vulnerabilities, organizations can reduce the risk of security misconfiguration and other security threats.OWASP - Security MisconfigurationsA06-2021: Vulnerable and Outdated ComponentsVulnerable and outdated components are security weaknesses that arise from the use of third-party software components with known security vulnerabilities or outdated versions of software components that are no longer supported by the vendor. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to exploit flaws in the components to gain unauthorized access to data or carry out other malicious activities.Vulnerable and outdated components include: Unpatched software vulnerabilities: Applications that use outdated versions of software components with known security vulnerabilities are vulnerable to attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities. Insecure libraries: Applications that use insecure libraries, such as OpenSSL, that have known security vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to data. Deprecated software: Applications that use software that is no longer supported by the vendor, such as Windows XP, are vulnerable to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in the software. To prevent this, developers and security professionals must monitor and maintain the software components used in their applications. This includes regularly updating and patching software components to address known vulnerabilities and ensuring that all components are still supported by the vendor.Additionally, developers and/or development teams should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in their applications and take appropriate steps to mitigate them. This may include removing insecure or unnecessary components, upgrading to newer versions of components, or implementing additional security controls to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.This type of vulnerability can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By monitoring and maintaining the software components used in their applications, regularly updating and patching components, and conducting regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of vulnerable and outdated components and other security threats.OWASP - Vulnerable and Outdated ComponentsA07-2021: Identification and Authentication FailuresIdentification and authentication failures refer to security weaknesses that arise from flaws in the way that users are identified and authenticated in web applications and other software systems. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to data or carry out other malicious activities by bypassing the authentication mechanism.Identification and authentication failures include: Weak password policies: Applications that do not enforce strong password policies are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and password guessing. Insufficient account lockout policies: Applications that do not lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. Insecure password storage: Applications that store passwords in plaintext or use weak encryption algorithms are vulnerable to password theft. Lack of multi-factor authentication: Applications that rely on single-factor authentication, such as username and password, are vulnerable to attacks that bypass the authentication mechanism. To prevent identification and authentication failures, developers and security professionals must implement strong identification and authentication mechanisms that adhere to industry best practices. This includes enforcing strong password policies, implementing multi-factor authentication, and using secure password storage mechanisms such as hash functions with salt.Also, developers should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in their authentication mechanisms and take appropriate steps to mitigate them. This may include implementing additional security controls, such as rate limiting and account lockout policies, to prevent brute-force attacks.Identification and authentication failures can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By implementing strong identification and authentication mechanisms, adhering to industry best practices, and conducting regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of identification and authentication failures and other security threats.OWASP - Identification and Authentication FailuresA08-2021: Software and Data Integrity FailuresSoftware and data integrity failures refer to security weaknesses that arise from flaws in the way that software and data are stored, processed, and transmitted. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to manipulate or destroy data, compromise the integrity of software, or carry out other malicious activities.Some examples of software and data integrity failures include: Code injection attacks: Applications that lack properly sanitize user input are vulnerable to code injection attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into the application to carry out unauthorized activities. Man-in-the-middle attacks: Applications that aren’t using secure communication protocols, such as SSL or TLS, are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify data transmitted between the client and server. File inclusion vulnerabilities: Applications that don’t properly validate user input in file inclusion mechanisms, such as include or require statements, are vulnerable to file inclusion attacks, where an attacker can include malicious code into the application. Data tampering: Applications that do not properly validate user input or protect against unauthorized modifications are vulnerable to data tampering attacks, where an attacker can modify or delete data stored in the application. To prevent these failures, developers and security professionals must implement strong security controls that ensure the integrity of software and data. This includes implementing input validation and output encoding mechanisms to prevent code injection attacks, using secure communication protocols to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, and implementing access controls and data encryption to protect against data tampering and unauthorized modifications.Also, developers should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in their software and data storage mechanisms and take appropriate steps to mitigate them.

By implementing strong security controls, adhering to industry best practices, and conducting regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of software and data integrity failures and other security threats.OWASP - Software and Data Integrity FailuresA09-2021: Security Logging and Monitoring FailuresSecurity logging and monitoring failures refer to security weaknesses that arise from flaws in the way that security logs are generated, stored, and monitored. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to carry out malicious activities without being detected, or can prevent security teams from identifying and responding to security incidents in a timely manner.Security logging and monitoring failures include: Insufficient logging: Applications that do not generate sufficient security logs are vulnerable to attacks that cannot be detected or traced back to the attacker. Lack of real-time monitoring: Applications that do not implement real-time monitoring mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that can go undetected for long periods of time, allowing attackers to carry out further malicious activities. Incomplete log analysis: Applications that do not properly analyze and correlate security logs are vulnerable to attacks that can be disguised or split across multiple logs, making them difficult to identify. Limited incident response capabilities: Applications that do not have a defined incident response process or lack the necessary tools and expertise to respond to security incidents are vulnerable to prolonged and more severe attacks. To prevent these failures, developers and security professionals must implement strong security logging and monitoring mechanisms that adhere to industry best practices. This includes generating sufficient security logs that capture all relevant events, implementing real-time monitoring mechanisms that detect security incidents as they occur, and conducting comprehensive log analysis to identify potential security threats.Also, developers should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in their security logging and monitoring mechanisms and take appropriate steps to mitigate them. This may include implementing additional security controls, such as intrusion detection systems and security information and event management (SIEM) tools, to improve their incident response capabilities.Security logging and monitoring failures can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By implementing strong security logging and monitoring mechanisms, adhering to industry best practices, and conducting regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of security logging and monitoring failures and other security threats.OWASP - Security Logging and Monitoring FailuresA10-2021: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a type of web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to send unauthorized requests from a vulnerable server to other internal or external systems. SSRF attacks can be used to bypass security controls, access sensitive information, or carry out further attacks on other systems.SSRF attacks typically involve exploiting web application functionality that allows the application to send requests to other systems. This functionality can be used by an attacker to send requests to internal systems, such as databases or other backend servers, or to external systems, such as cloud services or other web applications.Examples of SSRF vulnerabilities include: Malicious URL redirection: An attacker can craft a malicious URL that redirects the vulnerable server to a target system, allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or carry out further attacks. Request smuggling: An attacker can manipulate the HTTP request headers to trick the vulnerable server into sending requests to other systems. Proxy abuse: An attacker can use the vulnerable server as a proxy to access other systems, bypassing any security controls in place. To prevent these attacks, developers should implement strong input validation and output encoding mechanisms to prevent attackers from injecting malicious requests into the web application. This may include implementing a whitelist of allowed URLs or IP addresses, using DNS resolution to validate external URLs, and restricting access to internal systems.Also, developers should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities and take appropriate steps to mitigate them. This may include implementing additional security controls, such as web application firewalls or network segmentation, to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive systems.SSRF attacks can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By implementing strong security controls, adhering to industry best practices, and conducting regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of SSRF attacks and other security threats.OWASP - Server Side Request Forgery SSRFConclusionDevelopers should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities and take appropriate steps to mitigate them.The OWASP Top 10 is an important tool for software developers and security professionals. By understanding the vulnerabilities outlined in the OWASP Top 10, developers can take steps to improve the security of their applications and protect against common attack vectors. It is important to keep in mind that the OWASP Top 10 is not a comprehensive list of all possible vulnerabilities, and developers should take a holistic approach to application security.┌──(robert㉿kali)-[~] └─$ docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-full-scan.py -t http://yourwebsite.com..." }, { "title": "The Stuxnet Worm", "url": "/posts/stuxnet/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, computer fraud and abuse act, electronic communications privacy act, data availability, data integrity, data confidentiality, authentication, stuxnet, computer worms, computer viruses, malware, usb attack", "date": "2023-03-09 17:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "In 2010, a computer worm known as Stuxnet made headlines around the world. Its target was an Iranian nuclear facility, and it was designed to disrupt and damage the centrifuges used in the facility’s uranium enrichment program. Stuxnet was unlike any other malware that had been seen before, and it raised important questions about the growing threat of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.Computer WormsTo understand Stuxnet, we need to understand what a computer worm is. A computer worm is a type of malware that is designed to spread from computer to computer. Unlike viruses, which need a host program to replicate, worms are self-replicating and can spread without any human intervention.Forbes - The Story Behind The Stuxnet VirusComputer worms can be used for a variety of reasons, from stealing sensitive data to launching denial-of-service attacks. Some worms are designed to create backdoors into computer systems, which can then be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive data or to launch further attacks.Stuxnet: A Sophisticated WormStuxnet wasn’t the first computer worm to make headlines, but it was arguably the most sophisticated. It was designed to target a specific type of industrial control system called a programmable logic controller (PLC). PLCs are used to control machinery in factories, power plants, and other critical infrastructure.Stuxnet was designed to be delivered through USB drives, and it was programmed to search for specific PLCs that were used in the Iranian nuclear facility. Once it infected a PLC, it would lie dormant for a period of time before activating and causing the centrifuges to spin out of control. This caused significant damage to the facility’s infrastructure, and it set back Iran’s nuclear program by several years.Time of Israel - ‘Dutch mole’ planted Stuxnet virus in Iran nuclear site on behalf of CIA, MossadThe RootkitAs a rootkit, Stuxnet, was able to conceal its presence in multiple ways. It used a combination of kernel-mode drivers, file-system filters, and other techniques to hide files and processes from both the operating system and the user. It also employed a number of anti-debugging and anti-analysis techniques to make it difficult for security researchers to study its behavior.The rootkit component of Stuxnet was critical to its success, as it allowed the malware to remain undetected on infected systems for an extended period of time. This gave it ample opportunity to spread through Iran’s nuclear program and carry out its mission of disrupting the centrifuges used to enrich uranium.Stuxnet is the most famous rootkit as of this writing.ScienceDirect -StuxnetOrigins of StuxnetThe origins of Stuxnet are still shrouded in mystery, but it is widely believed to have been a joint operation between the United States and Israel. The worm was first discovered by a Belarusian security company, and it quickly became clear that it was unlike any other malware that had been seen before.Smithsonian Magazine - Richard Clarke on Who Was Behind the Stuxnet AttackThe fact that Stuxnet was designed to target a specific type of industrial control system raised important questions about the use of cyber attacks in warfare. Some experts argue that Stuxnet was a game-changer, and that it opened the door to a new era of cyber warfare.Homeland Security Today - Stuxnet and Beyond: The Origins of SCADA and Vulnerabilities to Critical InfrastructureProtecting Against WormsComputer worms are a serious threat to cybersecurity, and they can cause significant damage if they are not detected and stopped. There are several steps that individuals and organizations can take to protect themselves against worms and other types of malware.First and foremost, it is important to keep software up-to-date with the latest security patches. Many worms and other types of malware exploit known vulnerabilities in software, and keeping software updated can help prevent these attacks.It is also important to use antivirus software and to scan all files before opening them. Many worms are spread through email attachments or malicious websites, and scanning files before opening them can help prevent infection.Finally, it is important to be cautious when plugging any input output peripheral into computer systems. Stuxnet was able to spread through USB drives, and many other worms use similar methods. Avoid using USB drives from unknown sources, and scan all external devices before using them.Security.org - What Is a Computer Worm &amp;amp; How Do You Prevent Them?┌──(robert㉿kali)-[~]└─$ shutdown -h nowSHUTDOWN DENIEDYou are here -{FOREVER!}" }, { "title": "Zero Day Cyber Attack", "url": "/posts/zeroday/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, computer fraud and abuse act, electronic communications privacy act, zero day exploits, cyber attacks", "date": "2023-03-08 16:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Some cyber attacks are more impressive than others while causing significant damage to systems, networks, and organizations.The Zero-Day ExploitA Zero-Day exploit is a type of attack that targets vulnerabilities in software that haven’t been discovered or patched by the software developers. Because these vulnerabilities are unknown to the software developers, there are no patches or updates available to fix them. As a result, attackers can use these vulnerabilities to gain access to systems, steal sensitive information, or carry out other malicious activities.This type of attack will often be performed by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, who are highly skilled and motivated attackers that typically target government agencies, defense contractors, and other high-value targets. APT groups are known for using sophisticated techniques and tactics to infiltrate systems, such as spear-phishing campaigns and social engineering tactics.Zero-Day attacks can be particularly disruptive because they can go undetected for long periods of time, allowing attackers to carry out their activities undetected. Once the vulnerability is discovered and exploited, it can be difficult to remediate, and the impact of the attack can be significant.Stuxnet WormOne example of a Zero-Day is the Stuxnet worm, which was discovered in 2010. Stuxnet was a highly sophisticated malware attack that targeted industrial control systems (ICS) used in nuclear power plants and other critical infrastructure. The attack was believed to have been carried out by the US and Israel, and it caused significant damage to Iran’s nuclear program.PreventionPreventing Zero-Day attacks can be challenging, but there are steps that organizations can take to reduce their risk. Regularly updating software and systems with the latest patches and updates is one of the most effective ways to prevent Zero-Day exploits. Organizations can also implement intrusion detection systems and other security tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities.ConclusionZero-Day attacks are very disruptive cyber attacks, and they can cause significant damage to systems, networks, and organizations. By understanding the nature of these attacks and taking proactive steps to prevent them, businesses and individuals can protect themselves from these threats and reduce their risk of falling victim to cyber attacks.┌──(robert㉿kali)-[~] └─$ python3 zero-day.py 172.168.100.17 [!] Exploited[+] Session 1 Connected 172.168.100.17 $ pwd/" }, { "title": "Common Types of Cyber Attacks", "url": "/posts/typesofattacks/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, computer fraud and abuse act, electronic communications privacy act, data availability, data integrity, data confidentiality, authentication, authorization, components of cybersecurity, confidentiality, privacy, security, encryption, information, sensitive data, common types of cyber attacks, malware attacks, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ddos, man-in-the-middle attacks, ransomware attacks", "date": "2023-03-08 11:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "In today’s digital world, as technology continues to advance, so do the methods of cyber attacks. With the increase of technology, businesses, individuals and governments have become more vulnerable to various cyber attacks. In this article, we will briefly discuss five common types of cyber attacks, Malware attacks, Phishing attacks, Denial of Service attacks, Man-in-the-middle attacks, and Ransomware attacks.Malware attacks:Malware, short for malicious software, is a type of attack that seeks to infiltrate your system or network and cause damage or steal sensitive information. Malware can come in many forms, including viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware. Once malware infects your system, it can carry out a range of malicious activities, such as stealing personal data or passwords, hijacking your system, or destroying files.Phishing attacks:Phishing is a form of social engineering attack that relies on tricking the victim into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or financial data. Attackers usually send emails or messages that appear to be legitimate, such as from a bank or service provider, but contain malicious links or attachments. Once the victim clicks on these links, they are taken to a fake website designed to steal their credentials or install malware on their device.Denial of Service attacks:Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are designed to disrupt the availability of a service, website, or network by overwhelming it with traffic. Attackers can flood the target with traffic from multiple sources, making it impossible for legitimate users to access the service. DoS attacks can be carried out by botnets, which are networks of compromised devices controlled by the attacker.Man-in-the-middle attacks:Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks occur when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, such as a client and a server. The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, modify the data, or inject malicious code into the stream. MitM attacks can be carried out through various means, such as by compromising a public Wi-Fi network or through a malware infection.Ransomware attacks:Ransomware attacks are a type of malware attack that encrypts the victim’s files, making them inaccessible unless a ransom is paid. Ransomware typically spreads through malicious attachments, links, or downloads. Once the victim’s files are encrypted, they will receive a message from the attacker demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key.ConclusionCyber attacks are a growing concern that threatens the security of businesses, governments, and individuals. By understanding the different types of cyber attacks, we can take steps to protect ourselves and our systems from malicious actors. It’s important to keep our software up-to-date, use antivirus software, and be aware of the warning signs of phishing attacks. By following best practices, we can reduce the risk of falling victim to cyber attacks and protect our sensitive information.┌──(robert㉿kali)-[~] └─$ python3 arp-spoof.py 172.168.100.17 172.168.100.1 --verbose[!] Enabling IP Routing...[+] IP Routing Enabled.[+] Sent to 172.168.100.17 : 172.168.100.1 is-at 3c:40:00:22:10:00" }, { "title": "Authentication &amp; Authorization", "url": "/posts/authandauth/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, computer fraud and abuse act, electronic communications privacy act, authorization, authenticaiton, access control, permissions", "date": "2023-03-07 16:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "In cybersecurity, authentication and authorization are two distinct but closely related concepts that are essential for securing access to information and resources.AuthenticationAuthentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It is typically accomplished through a combination of something a user knows (like a password or PIN), something they have (like a smart card or token), or something they are (like a fingerprint or other biometric characteristic). Authentication is used to establish trust between the user and the system, and to ensure that only authorized users are granted access to sensitive information or resources.For example, when a user logs into an email account, they may be prompted to provide a username and password. The system will then verify that the username and password match the credentials stored in its database, and if they do, the user will be granted access to their email inbox.AuthorizationAuthorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or information based on a user’s authenticated identity. Once a user’s identity has been verified through authentication, authorization determines what actions that user is allowed to perform and what information they are allowed to access.For example, in a school setting, a teacher may have authorization to access certain files or systems that a student does not have access to. Similarly, a school administrator may have authorization to modify student records, while a teacher may only have authorization to view them.SummaryAuthentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on that identity. Both are critical components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, and understanding the differences between them is essential for protecting sensitive information and resources.┌──(robert㉿kali)-[~] └─$ sudo apt get update -y[sudo] password for robert: " }, { "title": "Cybersecurity and Data Availability", "url": "/posts/availability/", "categories": "Blog, Cybersecurity", "tags": "cybersecurity, cyber, security, computer fraud and abuse act, electronic communications privacy act, data availability, data integrity, data confidentiality, authentication, authorization, components of cybersecurity, confidentiality, privacy, security, encryption, information, sensitive data availability, redundancy, backups, monitoring", "date": "2023-03-07 10:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Availability is another important aspect of cybersecurity, as it ensures that authorized users are able to access information and resources when they need them. This is essential for businesses and organizations that rely on digital systems to run their operations, as well as for individuals who use digital devices and services for work, education, and entertainment.Ensuring availability involves a number of strategies, such as: Redundancy: This means having multiple systems or components in place to ensure that if one fails, another can take over. For example, a business might have multiple servers that can host their website or other digital services, so that if one goes down, the others can keep running. Backups: This means making copies of important data and storing them in a secure location, so that if the original data is lost or damaged, it can be restored from the backup. Backups can be created on a regular basis, and can be stored either locally or in the cloud. Monitoring: This means keeping an eye on systems and networks to ensure that they are running smoothly and to detect any potential issues. This can be done using tools like network monitoring software, which can alert administrators to any problems that arise. Ensuring availability is particularly important in critical infrastructure systems, such as power grids, transportation networks, and healthcare systems. In these cases, any disruption in service could have serious consequences for public safety and well-being.Overall, availability is essential for ensuring that digital systems and services are reliable and accessible when they are needed.

You can repeat this process while you figure out the interfaces you would like to use.Just select option 1 when prompted for option selections at the ** pfsenseWelcome Screen**.From here you should observe the LAN address to connect to pfsense from a browser. The default will be: Login Portal: https://192.168.0.1:8096Default Credentials Username: admin Password: pfsensepfsense is installed and can be configured from a browser on the network. I usually connect a laptop to the lan connection to continue to configure pfsense.When you connect to the login portal you will observe a connection warning. Click Advanced and Proceed. This warning is because the cert isn’t properly setup, and isn’t something I will cover in this guide.Now you can login with the default credentials and further configure pfsense.Quick Post Install TipIt’s ideal to login and change the default credentials.Navigating to User Manager within the System drop down menu.Now add a new user to replace the default user by clicking + Add.Fill out the form fields for the new user and make sure to add the new user into the admins in Group Membership.

My focus in this article is to provide some of the information that helped me along the way.You have to start somewhere. I’m not sure where you are in your journey for tech knowledge, or where you want to go. I always suggest to start with looking at some jobs. For example: Indeed - IT Remote Jobs Indeed - IT Entry Level Web Dev Jobs Indeed - Entry Level Cyber Security Remote Jobs Examin the requirements for the jobs you look up. Try various job boards. Then start down a path focused on learning those skills by utilizing free resources (Google, YouTube, and Reddit are great for this).Depending what it is you want to learn there are also paid platforms like Udemy, Coursera, AWS Training, Oracle University, LinkedIn Learning, and so much more.Switching CareersSwitching careers can be tough to do. I had a lot of emotions about this myself and it took me a long time. My advice is that you should at least be teaching yourself another skill if you have time.That meant I had to make adjustments in my personal life that weren’t easy.There are a lot of jobs that can leverage leadership skills in IT Management. People with this skill set may want to look at Project + and ITIL type certifications. Customer Support Manager IT Project Manager Remember that you have skills you already bring to the table. Try to leverage those skills if you’re switching careers.What I Did - The Very Short VersionMy situation and your situation are different so we can’t really compare what I did to how you decide to do it.I started with a lot of the above mentioned “free resources”. What motivated my interest in learning was haacking, and there is a lot of research that goes into it. A great platform to get started today that didn’t exist when I began is Tryhackme. I started with Vulnhub.Then I moved onto Udemy for Colt Steele’s Web Dev Bootcamp - Updated for 2023. This came at the advice of /r webdev where I found many posts suggesting this course in opposition to a coding bootcamp. Then I got into the A+, Network+, Security+, Cysa+, and you get the point. I bought courses for around $10 each, and only bought when the sales came up.Over the years I’ve set up a lot of fun homelab projects. I buy tech to tinker (when I was able to afford it). I learned to step away from some biases. An example bias being I never liked Apple phones, but I had to get one to learn iOS. Linux looked complicated, but I had to just get in it to step away from years of Windows comfort.Learning takes time. It can be very frustrating, and you’ll need patience. Good sleep helps with figuring out issues. There are times I go to bed thinking about something, and wake up with the solution.List of Noteable Learning ResourcesNote This list isn’t complete and will be updated.

I’ll link to some resources on these in the future, and job searches you can do to find this type of work.Closing StatementGetting past HR may require certifications and/or school. I opted to enroll myself into WGU after a conversation with a recruiter. I’d also make the point that most of the people I work with do not have an education; however, they have many more years of experience. Sometimes you have to go the extra mile to get what you want, and I wanted HR to pull my resume so I could get into interviews. I’d still highly recommend learning what you can on your own before jumping onto any education platforms. School isn’t for everyone, and WGU particularly. Do a lot of research before you spend money.Some of the benefits of joining WGU and the WGU Cyber Club: CCDC NICE Challenges NCL Tryhackme Nights Hackthebox Nights Job listings Study groupsAlso, setup home labs and tinker.

More often than not, automated security tools and scripts will miss many potential vulnerabilities and useful information.Here is a short breakdown of the built-in browser tools you will use throughout this room: View Source - Use your browser to view the human-readable source code of a website. Inspector - Learn how to inspect page elements and make changes to view usually- blocked content. Debugger - Inspect and control the flow of a page’s JavaScript Network - See all the network requests a page makes.Room: TryHackMe - Walking an ApplicationExploring the WebsiteAs a penetration tester, your role when reviewing a website or web application is to discover features that could potentially be vulnerable and attempt to exploit them to assess whether or not they are. These features are usually parts of the website that require some interactivity with the user.Finding interactive portions of the website can be as easy as spotting a login form to manually reviewing the website’s JavaScript. An excellent place to start is just with your browser exploring the website and noting down the individual pages/areas/features with a summary for each one.An example site review for the Acme IT Support website would look something like this: Feature URL Summary Home Page / This page contains a summary of what Acme IT Support does with a company photo of their staff. Latest News /news This page contains a list of recently published news articles by the company, and each news article has a link with an id number, i.e. /news/article?id=1 News Article /news/article?id=1 Displays the individual news article. Some articles seem to be blocked and reserved for premium customers only. Contact Page /contact This page contains a form for customers to contact the company. It contains name, email and message input fields and a send button. Customers /customers This link redirects to /customers/login. Customer Login /customers/login This page contains a login form with username and password fields. Customer Signup /customers/signup This page contains a user-signup form that consists of a username, email, password and password confirmation input fields. Customer Reset Password /customers/reset Password reset form with an email address input field. Customer Dashboard /customers This page contains a list of the user’s tickets submitted to the IT support company and a “Create Ticket” button. Create Ticket /customers/ticket/new This page contains a form with a textbox for entering the IT issue and a file upload option to create an IT support ticket. Customer Account /customers/account This page allows the user to edit their username, email and password. Customer Logout /customers/logout This link logs the user out of the customer area. Viewing The Page SourceThe page source is the human-readable code returned to our browser/client from the web server each time we make a request.The returned code is made up of HTML ( HyperText Markup Language), CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) and JavaScript, and it’s what tells our browser what content to display, how to show it and adds an element of interactivity with JavaScript.For our purposes, viewing the page source can help us discover more information about the web application.How do I view the Page Source? While viewing a website, you can right-click on the page, and you’ll see an option on the menu that says View Page Source. Most browsers support putting view-source: in front of the URL for example, view-source:https://www.google.com/ In your browser menu, you’ll find an option to view the page source. This option can sometimes be in submenus such as developer tools or more tools.TryHackMe provides more information, visit the room to read further!Viewing the Page Source WalkthroughIt’s time to start locating flags! First deploy the machine…You should be able to access the web app now.As the room explains, view the page source.Right away I identify the new homepage @ /new-home-beta at the top of the source code.I’ll just grab that…Paste that next to the IP of the machine IP in the browser, navigating to http://machine-ip/new-home-beta, like below and we have our first flag!The next question is asking about the secrets page, so look through the source code for something about secrets and you’ll observe:Grab that and put it in the browser next to the machine IP again as you did above, navigating to http://machine-ip/secrets-page.Now that you’ve obtained the secrets flag It’s time to complete this section!The next question is asking for the directory flag. This one had me think for a moment. I observed the assets directory in the source code, so I figured to poke at it.As you can see there is flag.txt in this directory. You’ll want to open that up to obtain the flag.The final question of the section is asking for a framework flag. I recalled seeing this in the notes of the source at the bottom.Copy and paste into your browser https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/thm-web-framework/.This question required a little more exploring. Check out the Change Log.Here we can find that a backup process created a file in the web directory called /tmp.zip.Navigate back to the machine IP, and paste /tmp.zip to download the compressed file.Navigate to the location where you saved the tmp.zip file to unzip, and read it.After unzipping the file just use the cat command to output the text contents.Developer Tools - InspectorDeveloper ToolsEvery modern browser includes developer tools; this is a tool kit used to aid web developers in debugging web applications and gives you a peek under the hood of a website to see what is going on. As a pentester, we can leverage these tools to provide us with a much better understanding of the web application. We’re specifically focusing on three features of the developer tool kit, Inspector, Debugger and Network.Opening Developer ToolsThe way to access developer tools is different for every browser. If you’re not sure how to access it, click the “View Site” button on the top right of this task to get instructions on how to access the tools for your browser.InspectorThe page source doesn’t always represent what’s shown on a webpage; this is because CSS, JavaScript and user interaction can change the content and style of the page, which means we need a way to view what’s been displayed in the browser window at this exact time. Element inspector assists us with this by providing us with a live representation of what is currently on the website.As well as viewing this live view, we can also edit and interact with the page elements, which is helpful for web developers to debug issues.On the Acme IT Support website, click into the news section, where you’ll see three news articles.The first two articles are readable, but the third has been blocked with a floating notice above the content stating you have to be a premium customer to view the article. These floating boxes blocking the page contents are often referred to as paywalls as they put up a metaphorical wall in front of the content you wish to see until you pay.TryHackMe provides more information, visit the room to read further!Developer Tools - Inspector WalkthroughIt’s time to find the flag behind the paywall. I’m using firefox, so f12 opens the Firefox Developer Tools.Follow the instructions and navigate over to http://machine-ip/news/article?id=3Here you will observe, in the developer tools - inspector a div calass=premium-customer-blocker.In the CSS Styles Box, click on block and type the value none which will reveal the contentThe flag here appears to be an image, so I just typed it into the form field.Developer Tools - DebuggerThis panel in the developer tools is intended for debugging JavaScript, and again is an excellent feature for web developers wanting to work out why something might not be working. But as penetration testers, it gives us the option of digging deep into the JavaScript code. In Firefox and Safari, this feature is called Debugger, but in Google Chrome, it’s called Sources.On the Acme IT Support website, click on the contact page, each time the page is loaded, you might notice a rapid flash of red on the screen. We’re going to use the Debugger to work out what this red flash is and if it contains anything interesting. Debugging a red dot wouldn’t be something you’d do in the real world as a penetration tester, but it does allow us to use this feature and get used to the Debugger.In both browsers, on the left-hand side, you see a list of all the resources the current webpage is using. If you click into the assets folder, you’ll see a file named flash.min.js. Clicking on this file displays the contents of the JavaScript file.Many times when viewing javascript files, you’ll notice that everything is on one line, which is because it has been minimized, which means all formatting ( tabs, spacing and newlines ) have been removed to make the file smaller. This file is no exception to this, and it has also been obfusticated, which makes it purposely difficult to read, so it can’t be copied as easily by other developers.We can return some of the formattings by using the “Pretty Print” option, which looks like two braces { } to make it a little more readable, although due to the obfustication, it’s still difficult to comprehend what is going on with the file. If you scroll to the bottom of the flash.min.js file, you’ll see the line:TryHackMe provides more information, visit the room to read further!Developer Tools - Debugger WalkthroughThe instructions directed you to a contact page, so navigate over to *http://machine-ip/contactI used Debugger in Firefox, click on the flash.min.js file, and at the bottom of Debugger click on Pretty print source.Now you should be able to follow along with the instructions and insert a breakpoint.For me the breakpoint was at line 108. It’ll turn blue when the breakpoint is inserted.Now refresh the page.Your flag should appear!Nice work, onto the next section!Developer Tools - NetworkThe network tab on the developer tools can be used to keep track of every external request a webpage makes. If you click on the Network tab and then refresh the page, you’ll see all the files the page is requesting.Try doing this on the contact page; you can press the trash can icon to delete the list if it gets a bit overpopulated.With the network tab open, try filling in the contact form and pressing the Send Message button. You’ll notice an event in the network tab, and this is the form being submitted in the background using a method called AJAX. AJAX is a method for sending and receiving network data in a web application background without interfering by changing the current web page.TryHackMe provides more information, visit the room to read further!Developer Tools - Network WalkthroughThe instructions keep us at the contact page, so navigate over to *http://machine-ip/contact if you aren’t already there.Now we want to send a message while observing Network in Firefox Developer Tools.F12 &amp;gt; NetworkI added some filler information into the form and clicked Send Message.An event shows up in the network tab. This is the form being submitted through a method called Ajax.A file contact-msg appears.Open that file to retrieve the final flag.CreditThis is a free room, which means anyone can deploy virtual machines in the room (without being subscribed)! 98226 users are in here and this room is 427 days old at my time of writing this.Created by: tryhackmeThis room is part of the Jr Penetration Tester learning path." }, { "title": "TryHackMe - Intro to Offensive Security", "url": "/posts/intro-offensive/", "categories": "TryHackMe, Walkthrough", "tags": "tryhackme, thm, intro to offensive security, cybersecurity, pentest, junior pentester, red team, hacker", "date": "2022-08-20 22:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Getting StartedBefore going into cyber security careers and what offensive security is, let’s get you hacking (and yes, its legal, all exercises are fake simulations)Your first hackClick the “Start Machine” button.

Type the hidden page into the FakeBank website on the machine. I opened another tab and navigated to: http://machine-ip/bank-transferThis page allows an attacker to steal money from any bank account, which is a critical risk for the bank. As an ethical hacker, you would (with permission) find vulnerabilities in their application and report them to the bank to fix before a hacker exploits them.Transfer $2000 from the bank account 2276, to your account (account number 8881). Now go ahead and make the transfer: At this point I navigated to the bank account, machine’s IP, to obtain the flag to answer the final questionWhat is Offensive SecurityIn short, offensive security is the process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.To beat a hacker, you need to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cybercriminal does, as you did in this room!On the flip side, there is also defensive security, which is the process of protecting an organization’s network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats; learn more in the digital forensics room.In a defensive cyber role, you could be investigating infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cybercriminals, or monitoring infrastructure for malicious activity.CreditThis is a free room, which means anyone can deploy virtual machines in the room (without being subscribed)! 172763 users are in here and this room is 166 days old at the time of my writing.Created by ben and tryhackmeThis room is part of the Jr Penetration Tester learning path." }, { "title": "CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) Study Material", "url": "/posts/a-plus/", "categories": "Education, CompTIA A+", "tags": "comptia a+, a plus, certification, test, study, guide, wgu, c393, it foundations, mike meyers, dion training, udemy, pluralsight", "date": "2022-08-17 11:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "In progressThe CompTIA A+ is the only industry recognized credential with performance testing to prove pros can think on their feet to perform critical IT support tasks.

It allows the user to see the specifications of their computer, from the CPU to the GPU.Hertz This is the term used for Cycle per second.Giga This is the term used for Billion, and will also be found in combination with other terms.System Crystal A small, tiny quartz crystal located near the CPU that regulates the general speed of the CPU and the overall system.3.5 ghz Modern CPU’s do not run much faster than this maximum speed. It is possible, but very expensive to do.Hyperthreading This takes one core and makes it simulate 2 cores. Intel is one of the only manufacturers that use this technology.Level 1 Cache This is the first CPU cache level, generally smaller in size, but faster, and runs at a similar speed to the CPULevel 2 Cache This is the second CPU cache level, larger than the first, but slower, and runs around half the speed of the CPULevel 3 Cache This is the third CPU cache. Even larger than the second, but much slower, about the speed of a MoBo, and not all computers have it.32 Bit This CPU can only utilize up to ~4 gigabytes of RAM64 Bit This CPU is faster than its counterpart, and can utilize ~ an exabyte of RAMSystem Properties This is the location on a Windows computer where you may find information related to RAM, 32 or 64 bit systems, etc.Virtualization This is a CPU extension that enables a computer to simulate different operating systems.Integrated GPU This is a CPU extension that adds the functionality of a limited graphics card.Socket This is the part on the MoBo that holds the CPU. It is classified by pin amount, thermal dissipation, speed, size, etc.PGA Pin Grind Array CPU’s are under this classification for the amount of pins that they have. AMD generally use these for their CPU’sZIF Zero Insertion ForceLGA Land Grid Array The CPU Socket will have many contact pins that act as little springs in this socket type. Intel generally use these for their CPU’sLGA 775 This has 775 pins or lands on it. It is the first mainstream CPU that use the LGA. It ran with DDR2, and had a very long life of use.LGA 1156 This replaced the 775 variant, and it has 1156 pins. Was one of the first sockets to support a built-in North bridge, and was used primarily on mainstream systems. It also supported DDR3. Popular names included: I3, I5, I7LGA 1366 This replaced the 775 variant, and it has 1366 pins. It had a built-in memory controller, as well as a North bridge for PCI-E bus support. It supported DDR3, and was mainly used on the core I7LGA 1155 This replaced the LGA 1156 sockets. More mainstream CPU’s using this were the first to have full support of onboard graphics. These were the I3, I5, and I7.LGA 2011 This replaced the LGA 1366 sockets. At the higher end, it started out with DDR3 support, but moved to DD4. These sockets only supported PCI-E. Names include the Core I3, I5, and I7.LGA 1150 More mainstream socket, it supports multiple CPUs, Started with DDR3 support, then DDR4, and can support a very large amount of PCI-E Devices.AM2 This is an early AMD socket. It had 4 keys that mated with the CPU. It had 940 pins. It had hypertransport capability and supported DDR2.AM3 Almost identical to the AM2, the major difference was slightly larger keys. It had 941 pins, and supported Athlon 2, Phenom 2’s, etc, and supported DDR3. Almost identical to the AM2 and AM3, it supported Athlon 2, Phenom 2, and DDR3. It has 942 pins.APU Abbreviate: Accelerated Processing Unit AMD cores had this integrated into them for video functioning.FM1 The first to support AMD APU capabilities, it had 905 pins.FM2 The second to support AMD APU, it had 904 pins, with slight power and speed improvements.FM2+ The third to support AMD APU, it had 906 pins, with a substantial PCI-E support.Thermal Compound This must be placed between the CPU and the heatsink. Any time the heat sink is removed, this MUST be replaced.3 Prong System fans or case fans generally use this type of power connector.4 Prong System fans or case fans generally use this type of power connector. The main difference on this type is that it features an additional prong for a controllable fan. Most of the time you will see them for CPU fans, however it is not just limited to the CPU fan.OEM Original Equipment ManufacturerSpeedfan A generic utility for monitoring fan speed, it is a free program that can work with almost every computer.Passive Cooling This is a liquid cooling technique that uses a radiator to pump liquid through several tubes to help cool a CPUActive Cooling This is a liquid cooling technique that uses a refrigerator unit to pump refrigerant coolant through the computer to help keep it cool.Rebooting This can be a sign of an overheating CPU. The system will forcefully do this occasionally.RAM Random Access Memory Adding this to a system can greatly increase performance.DRAM Dynamic Random Access MemorySDRAM Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory This type of RAM uses a 168 pin DIMM. It also has 2 notches in it to lock into a MoBo. It is synchronized to the system clock. It used clock speed, which must be matched to the MoBo. Generally it came with a PC rating to match the MoBo. It can still be used in some systems today. It is generally characterized by a double or triple digit PC rating.DIMM Dual In-line Memory ModuleDDR Dual Data RateDDR SDRAM This type of RAM uses a 184 pin DIMM. It only has a single notch to match into a MoBo. It was capable of doubling a motherboard clock speed, making the RAM faster. It is generally characterized by 4 digit PC numbers. To calculate speeds, DDR will double the MoBo speeds. For example, 100 MHz becomes 200, 200 MHz becomes 400.x8 You will take a DDR speed and multiply it by this. For example, if a system is 100 Mhz and DDR SDRAM multiplied the speed to 200 MHz, you would multiply by this number to get the PC rating speed.DDR2 This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like its lesser counterpart, it uses a single slot to match a MoBo, however it is in a different location, preventing insertion into the wrong MoBo. It not only doubled the speeds like DDR, it also doubled the clock speeds. To calculate speeds, you will double the MoBo speed, then double the number again. The PC rating will have a PC2 number.DDR3 This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like its counterpart, it also uses a single slot, but it is also located in a different location to prevent insertion into the wrong slots. To calculate the speed, you calculate the MoBo speed x4. Then you will double that speed to get the actual speed of this RAM. This PC rating will have a PC3 number.Rambus RAM Characterized by a 184 pin RIMM, this type of RAM is long obsolete. It also has 2 notches to prevent insertion into the wrong MoBo. This type of RAM must always be installed in pairs.CRIMM Continuity RIMM When installing Rambus RAM modules, this type of stick must always be installed in the empty sockets. It does not have a function other than to terminate.Single Sided RAM This type of RAM only has memory on one side of a stick.Double Sided RAM This type of RAM has memory on both sides of a stick.ECC and parity RAM This type of RAM has extra chips designed for error correcting. It can only be used on motherboards that accept this type of RAM. Generally it is only located on servers.SODIMM Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module This type of RAM is only used in laptop systems. It has slightly lower capacity than its counterparts, however other than that feature it is nearly identical, except for it being smaller. It comes in 100, 144, 200 pins. 204 pins is unique to DDR3 ram.SPD Serial Presence DetectMTBF Mean Time Between FailuresMemtest86 A program available for users who have less than Windows 7, this program must be booted into to use, either with optical media or a flash drive. It enables the user to test the RAM of their system for consistency and failures.Windows Memory Diagnostic This program comes with every Windows 7 and later system. It is located under Administration Tools and helps to diagnose any issues related to memory.Software These types of programs are stored on harddrives.

Disk mirroring is a good choice for applications that require high performance and high availability, such as transactional applications, email and operating systems.RAID 5RAID 5 is a redundant array of independent disk configuration that uses disk striping with parity. Because data and parity are striped evenly across all of the disks, no single disk is a bottleneck. Striping also allows users to reconstruct data in case of a disk failure.RAID 5 results in the loss of storage capacity equivalent to the capacity of one hard drive from the volume. For example, three 500GB hard drives added together comprise 1500GB (or roughly about 1.5 terabytes) of storage.RAID 10Also known as RAID 1+0, is a RAID configuration that combines disk mirroring and disk striping to protect data. It requires a minimum of four disks and stripes data across mirrored pairs. As long as one disk in each mirrored pair is functional, data can be retrieved.RAID 50Known as RAID 5+0, combines distributed parity (RAID 5) with striping (RAID 0). It requires a minimum of six drives. This RAID level offers better write performance, increased data protection and faster rebuilds than RAID 5.Professor Messer RAIDPrintersLaser Laser writes negatively charged areas to the drum Positively charged toner is then attracted to the drum Pickup rollers bring paper into the printer Separation pad ensures that a single piece of paper is fed into the printer Toner on drum is then transferred to negatively charged paper via the transfer belt, part of the fuser assemblyProfessor Messer Laser PrintersInkjet Uses ink cartridges moved across paper by a carriage belt Rollers feed paper into the printer Pressure or electrical pulses force ink out of tiny nozzles Cartridge nozzle calibration Cartridge replacement is expensive Consider print pages per minute (PPM) 30 PPM = 30 pages of textProfessor Messer Inkjet PrintersThermal Common with POS receipts Uses coated paper (use the correct heat sensitivity paper) Regions on the paper are heated to form the printout and then darkenProfessor Messer Thermal PrintersImpact Dot matrix printers A print head uses electrical charges for pins to form shapes Print head pins impact paper through an ink ribbon to form characters on paper Useful for printing multiple carbon copies in one print passProfessor Messer Impact Printers3D Useful for creating simple replacement parts, product prototyping 3D modeling using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software Uses material layering to create physical objects on the print bedConsumables: Wax Plastic compound (filament) 3D printer resin Powder and glue Rendered 3D objects may need time to dry or cureProfessor Messer 3D PrintersPrinter Interfaces and MaintenanceInterfaces: USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth, Wi-FiClient printer drivers, permissions to print (ACL, smartcard)Consumables: Replace paper, toner, ink, wax, plastic/resin, powder, glueClean rollers, clear paper jams, remove printing debrisPrinter ConsumablesProfessor Messer Printer Components, Consumables, and Interfaces - Part 1 of 2Professor Messer Printer Components, Consumables, and Interfaces - Part 2 of 2Cloud Printing Ability to print from any device on any network Requires an association between a printer and a cloud account Printers are managed in the cloud Print jobs are sent to the cloud and then removedMultifunction Device ConfigurationsNetwork Settings Wired: Ethernet, USB, serial Wireless: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Security settingsSettings Email, network folder, fax, computerPower ManagementFirewall RulesAdministrative SettingsComputer PowerPower SupplyPower ConnectorsProfessor Messer Computer PowerVirtualization and Cloud Computing (11%)Type 1 Hypervisor - Bare MetalCloud Computing - Cloud computing enables companies to consume a compute resource, such as a virtual machine, storage, or an application, as a utility – just like electricity – rather than having to build and maintain computing infrastructures in-house.Professor Messer Cloud ModelsCloud DeploymentsVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI, refers to the process of running a user desktop inside a virtual machine that lives on a server in the datacenter.

(T0485)ScenarioAfter a review, I was made aware that some of our computers are not up to security configuration standards, leaving the machines open to multiple vulnerabilities that could be catastrophic if exploited. I need you to configure specific machines to comply with specific configurations found in DISA’s (Defense Information Systems Agency) Security Technical Implementation Guide.Additional InformationMore details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following…Username: playeronePassword: password123The username/password used to access the Firewall’s web interface within the workspace will be the following…Username: adminPassword: password123Mission StartI began work on this challenge on 5 MAR 2022, at at 15:45 hours, with the following meeting: Gary Thatcher: @playerone, It looks like some of our machines aren’t as secure as we might have thought, there is some configuration I’d like you to perform on the Prod-Web machine to close up some of the holes that are there. Ione Leventis: I’ve done some research for a good configuration guide and I’ve found something called a Security Technical Implementation Guide. I’ve gone ahead and dropped both the guide and the viewing tool on the Security-Desk. You should make sure the machine is configured with some of the CAT II specifications. Specifically, I have a range of the CAT II configs I’ll want you to implement. Richard LeGrand: WE HAVE VULNERABILITIES??!!! WHAT IS GOING ON??? GET THIS FIXED….YESTERDAY!!!!!! Ione Leventis: For now, I want you fix any findings you come accross within the range of rule 13 (V-204406) through rule 31 (V-204426). Just make sure you’re filtering via only CAT II rules. However, if you come accross any user specific fixes, please leave the nagios account alone, otherwise our MSP wont be able to monitor our environment anymore and that will cause a lot headaches for everyone. Ione Leventis: Oh, and make sure you don’t unzip the Red Hat Enterprise Linux STIG, just import it straight into the viewer itself. I know our Prod-Web is CentOS 7 but the rules I need you to cover will still apply. Keep in mind the STIG and STIG Viewer are both located on the Security-Desk, however the issues you will be solving are on Prod-Web.I logged into the Security-Desk, after the meeting, and used an ssh

I may have forgot the password to get into my 7-zipped folder which contains very important files that i need. I have all my passwords written on a document file however its just showing weird symbols and one of my pictures just gives me an error message and wont open. I put everything I found that was acting weird on a thumb drive and gave it to Ione. Please fix this for me as soon as you can!! Ione Leventis:@playerone, I took a quick look at the thumb drive and I may have an idea of what is going on. Get a hex-editor and take a look into those files that aren’t being recognized. I’ve gone ahead and plugged the drive into the Workstation-Desk machine. Richard LeGrand:@SCHANEL SAYS HE CAN’T GET HIS WORK DONE WITHOUT THESE FILES - MAKE IT HAPPEN Sergio Chanel:@playerone, please extract each individual file from any folders they’re in and just leave them in the same place my picture and document are if you could, makes it easier for me.Mission NarrativeI accessed the workstation-desk and examined the files located in the ‘E:/flash drive’. I attempted to open oh.jpg, but observed an error “Couldn’t Open Something Went Wrong.”I then examined the magic numbers by uploading the file onto https://hexed.it and observed the numbers to be incorrect in accordance with the jpeg file format.The magic numbers I observed were “EE A9 FB B0 00” and should be “FF D8 FF E0”. I modified the magic numbers, and saved oh.jpg into my /Downloads directory. I was then able to open the file and observe the image.Next, I examined the Definetlynotpasswords.docx file. I was able to open this file with 7z, and observe archived contents. Inside of the archived contents was a file documents.xml, which contained the password “File$ignature3An4L1sys”.I was able to use this password to open up the Musthave.7z file, and extract the contents. The extracted contents now exist inside of ‘E;/Musthave’. Sergio requested that I extract the contents from ‘E;/Musthave’ to the E:/, so I did that.This resulted in all challenge checks being met at 03:53 PM PST on February 20, 2022.Each NICE Challenge has the following core elements: a narrative-driven scenario, a business environment (workspace), and a set of technical objectives and/or a written deliverable.

An organization can be an entire company, a department within a company, or even just a small group of people focused around a singular set of objectives.Service By definition, services is a means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.Product A configuration of resources, created by the organization that will be potentially valuable to customers.Service Offering A specific mix of services and products sold to a specific customer. A description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group (which may include goods, access to resources, and service actions). Goods Ownership is transferred to the customer. Access to resources Customer is allowed to use it. Service Actions Things the service provider does for the customer. Output A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity. For example, a ‘Profit and Loss statement’ being produced might be an output of an accounting program.Outcome A result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs ! By definition, outcome is a result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs. In other words, outcomes allow service consumers to achieve a desired result.Cost Can be removed from the customer (part of the value proposition), and can be imposed on the customer (price for service consumption).Risk Uncertainty of an outcome. Can be good (opportunity) or bad (hazard). a possible event that could cause harm or loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives. Risk can also be defined as uncertainty of outcome and can be used in the context of measuring the probability of positive outcomes, as well as negative outcomes.Utility Fit for purpose. Service does what it is meant to do. Utility is the functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need.Warranty Fit for use. Is the service availability, capacity, continuity, and security good enough? Customer defines this!Value = Utility + Warranty ( + perception)Key Concepts Service Management Stakeholders Value Value Co-CreationDefinitions Service Service Offerings Output Vs. Outcome Risk Utility + WarrantyThe 4 Dimensions of Service Management (2)Service Management - A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services.Organizations &amp;amp; People Organizational structures Decision making habits Staffing and skill requirementsInformation &amp;amp; Technology Information and tools needed Technologies and innovation Relationship between components Culture of knowledge managementPartners &amp;amp; Suppliers Relationship with external vendors Factors that influence suppliers strategies Service integration management Vendor selection proceduresValue Streams &amp;amp; Processes Activities the organization undertakes ! Organization of these activities Ensuring value to stakeholders ! Exercise value stream mapping Note: Can be influenced by the organizationPESTLE - External factors that cannot be influenced but need to be considered. Political Economical Social Technological Legal EnvironmentalThe Service Value System (1)SVSGuiding principles: Recommendations that can guide an organization in all circumstances, regardless of changes in its goals, strategies, type of work, or management structure.Governance: The means by which an organization is directed and controlled.Service value chain: A set of interconnected activities that an organization performs to deliver a valuable product or service to its consumers and to facilitate value realization.Practices: Sets of organizational resources designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective.Continual improvement: A recurring organizational activity performed at all levels to ensure that an organization’s performance continually meets stakeholders’ expectations. ITIL 4 supports continual improvement with the ITIL continual improvement model.The Service value system converts opportunity and demand by applying our own service management magic into actual value for our customers. !The Guiding Principles (6)Recommendations that guide organizations in any circumstances, even for implementing ITIL 4 ! Focus on Value Everything you do must be somehow (directly or indirectly) valuable to your stakeholders. Start Where You Are Reuse existing resources whenever possible instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again. Progress Iteratively With Feedback Don’t do everything at once, take baby steps instead. Learning by doing with lots of feedback. Working in a timeboxed, iterative manner with feedback loops embedded into the process allows for: greater flexibility faster responses to customer and business needs the ability to discover and respond to failure earlier an overall improvement in quality. Having appropriate feedback loops between the participants of an activity gives them a better understanding of where their work comes from, where their outputs go, and how their actions and outputs affect the outcomes, which in turn enables them to make better decisions. Collaborate and Promote Visibility Involve the right people at the right time and gather factual data to make the right decisions. Think and Work Holistically Nothing is ever alone. Think about the effect of your initiative or work on other components. Keep it Simple and Practical Don’t overcomplicate work. Use the least possible steps. Outcome based thinking helps. Optimize and Automate Maximize the value of human work. Automate only after optimization. Apply DevOps. Summary of the guiding principles Universally applicable to any work or initiative Represent well-proven, good practice Are neither prescriptive nor a must Can be applied stand-alone but are better in conjunction Have a strong relation to Lean-Agile thinking The Service Value Chain (2)The service value chain is a part of the service value system. ! It’s an operating model which utilizes value streams. It has 6 different activities that transforms demand into value. !Value Stream: A series of steps an organization takes to co-create value with customers. These steps can be mapped to the SVC (service value chain) in any combination. E.g. handling of incidents or developing new applications.Value streams are focused on mapping the steps that are needed, and trying to find improvement opportunities in these steps. Find waste and eliminate it, and optimize flow to achieve value.Purpose of the ActivitiesPlan Ensures shared understanding of vision, current status and directionImprove Continual improvement of products and servicesEngage Understand stakeholder needs and demandsDesign and transition Make sure that services meet stakeholder needsObtain or build Ensure components are available when neededDeliver and support Ensure SLA (service level agreement) conform service deliveryThe Service Value Chain PIEDODPlan, Improve, Engage, Design and Transition, Obtain or Build, Deliver and Support Is an operating model Outlines activities needed to transform demand into value !

Ideas need to be reprioritized when new ones are added. ! It is a responsibility of everyone. ! Organizations may have a Continual Improvement Team for better coordination. All 4 Dimensions need to be considered during any improvement initiative.What is the vision? Align the mission and vision of improvement with the organization.Where are we now? Starting point of our improvement journey (guiding principal “start where you are”) where you are now. !Where do we want to be? Short term targets we need to achieve. Measurable targets (SMART Specifici, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound).How do we get there? How do we want to achieve our measurable targets? Agile, waterfall, setup teams, and projects.Take action Make sure we act on our plan of improvement.Did we get there? Did we achieve our goal and what lessons were learned?How do we keep the momentum going? Make sure we are continuing to improve and not going back to old habits.Change Enablement PracticePurpose: maximize the number of successful changes through proper risk assessment and minimize the negative impact of failed changes.Types: Standard: Pre-authorized, low risk, low cost, basically Service Requests. Normal: Authorization depends on what kind of change it is. Goes through the normal change workflow. Emergency: Requires rapid action. May have a separate change authority. Incident Management PracticePurpose: minimize the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal operation as soon as possible. Incident: unplanned interruption or reduction of quality. Must be logged, prioritized, and managed throughout their lifecycle. Uses the same categorizations as problem tickets. Swarming may help with complex issues. ! Major Incidents: need a separate procedure.! Swarming can be used for faster solutions. Problem Management PracticePurpose: reduce likelihood of recurring incidents by identifying root causes and eliminating them. Problem: Unknown cause of one or more incidents. ! Known Error: A problem with a known root case but no solution yet. Workaround: Alternate solution, reducing the impact of the problem.Phases: Problem Identification &amp;gt; Problem Control &amp;gt; Error Control ! Problem Identification: create a problem ticket and assign it to the correct team. Problem Control: joint effort between teams to analyze the problem, find the root cause, and provide a workaround for it. Error Control: initiate a change ticket, or request for changes if necessary. Changing something in the infrastructure, applications, configurations, or the code. A control practice needs to be in place which is the change enablement practice in this case!Service Desk PracticePurpose: capture demand for the incidents and service requests. Single point of contact between service provider and users.Issues request queries &amp;gt; SPOC &amp;gt; Acknowledge &amp;gt; Classify &amp;gt; Own &amp;gt; ActChannels: E-Mail Self-Service Phone Text Messaging Chat Forums Skills: Incident analysis and prioritization ! Effective communication Emotional intelligence Excellent customer service skillsService Level Management PracticePurpose: to set clear business-based targets for service performance, so that the delivery of a service can be measured properly.SLA: Service Level Agreement between customer, and service providers. !OLA: Operational Level Agreement between different units of the same organization.UC: Underpinning Contracts are an agreement between service provider and external supplier.Recommendations: CLear language, no jargon ! Should relate to defined outcomes ! Simply written, easy to understand ! Listen actively to customer needs !Service Request Management PracticePurpose: to support the agreed quality of services by handling all pre-defined, user initiated service requests.Service Request: a formal request for something other than incident resolution (e.g. information, advice, how-to questions…)Steps to fulfill requests should be well known (for both simple and complex requests). !When defining new workflows, try to reuse already existing ones. !User expectations must be managed in regards to what can be delivered.SUMMARYPractices Formerly known as processes More comprehensive view Include the 4 Dimensions Have specific goals Support SVC activities Continual Improvement Change Enablement Incident Management Problem Management Service Desk Service Level Management Service Request ManagementOther Examinable Practices (5)Information Security Management PracticeProtects information needed by organizations to conduct business.Ensures appropriate levels of: Confidentiality Integrity Availability Authentication Non-RepudiationRelationship Management PracticeEstablishes and nurtures links between organizations and stakeholders at strategic and tactical levels.Makes sure we find the best possible ways to communicate and collaborate with different internal and external stakeholders.Relationship lifecycle:Relationships are identified -&amp;gt; Analyzed -&amp;gt; Monitored -&amp;gt; Improved !Supplier Management PracticeEnsures that the supplier of the organization and their performances are managed to support seamless service provision to customers.The goal is to make sure “we get what we paid for” from our vendors and suppliers.Agreements and contracts are made in the form of UC’s (Underpinning Contracts).IT Asset Management PracticePlans and manages the full lifecycle of IT assets to: Maximize their value Control their costs Support decisions about reusing or purchasing new assetsIT Asset: any financially valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of IT products or services. !Monitoring &amp;amp; Event Management PracticeObserves services and components and records changes in their state. Identifies those events, categorizes them and establishes standard responses. Event: any change of state that has significance for the management of a configuration item or service. ! Types: Informational, Warning, Exception Release Management PracticeMakes new and changed services and features available for use. Release: a version of a service or other configuration items, or a collection of configuration items, that is made available for use. Releases have been disconnected from deployments with canary / dark releases. Other PracticesService Configuration Management PracticeEnsures accurate information is available when needed about services, configuration items and their relationships.CI (Configuration Item): any component that needs to be managed to deliver an IT service.CMDB (Configuration Management Database): a database or collection of databases holding CIs and their connections.CMS (Configuration Management System): a frontend / user interface for CMDBs.Deployment Management PracticeMoves new or changed hardware, software documentation or any other components from one environment to the next. E.g. Dev &amp;gt; QA &amp;gt; PRODWith the help of DevOps we can reach continuous delivery, where the developer builds the change in DEV, which is automatically tested and moved to the next environment until it arrives in PROD. Deployment does not equal release.SummaryRemember at least the purpose for the following practices: To ensure… Information Security Management Relationship Management Supplier Management IT Asset Management Monitoring &amp;amp; Event Management Release Management Service Configuration Management Deployment Management Other Definitions and ConceptsValuable terms and concepts that are covered throughout the various sections, which were emphasized in practice tests.IT Asset Any valuable component that can contribute to the delivery of an IT product or service.Customer Experience (CX) is an important element of value. The customer experience must be actively managed. The service provider must know how service consumers use each service and understand the entirety of the interactions that a customer has with an organization and its products to fully understand the customer experience. This is mainly identified and explored through a ‘focus on value’.Configuration Item Any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service.Event Any change of state that has significance for the management of a service or other configuration item.Change Enablement The practice of ensuring that risks are properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed, and managing a change schedule in order to maximize the number of successful IT changes.Relationship Management The practice of establishing and nurturing links between an organization and its stakeholders at strategic and tactical levels.Problem Management The practice of reducing the likelihood and impact of incidents by identifying actual and potential causes of incidents, and managing workarounds and known errors.Incident Management The practice of minimizing the negative impact of incidents by restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible.Continual Improvement The practice of aligning an organization’s practices and services with changing business needs through the ongoing identification and improvement of all elements involved in the effective management of products and services.Information Security Management The practice of protecting an organization by understanding and managing risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.Monitoring and Event Management The practice of systematically observing services and service components and recording and reporting selected changes of state identified as events.Service Level Management The practice of setting clear business-based targets for service performance so that the delivery of a service can be properly assessed, monitored, and managed against these targets.Service Configuration Management The practice of ensuring that accurate and reliable information about the configuration of services, and the configuration items that support them, is available when and where needed.Service Desk The practice of capturing demand for incident resolution and service requests. It should also be the entry point and single point of contact for the service provider with all of its users. A good service desk should have a practical understanding of the wider organization, the business processes, and the users.Service Relationship Management Refers to the joint activities performed by a service provider and a service consumer to ensure continual value co-creation based on agreed and available service offerings.A Guiding Principle Defined as a recommendation that can guide an organization in all circumstances and will guide organizations when adopting service management. They are not described as prescriptive or mandatory.The Guiding Principle of ‘Collaborate and Promote Visibility’ Focused on involving the right people in the correct roles in order to get additional buy-in for the project and increase the likelihood of long-term success. Relies on personnel working across boundaries to produce results that have greater buy-in, more relevance to objectives, and an increased likelihood of success.The Guiding Principle ‘Think and Work Holistically’ It is important to understand that no service, practice, process, department, or supplier works independently. Instead, each person needs to think about the service from an end-to-end perspective in order to ensure maximum compatibility and efficiency.The Guiding Principle of ‘Optimize and Automate’ Relies heavily on automation. Automation is the use of technology to perform a step or series of steps correctly and consistently with limited or no human involvement.The ‘Organization and People’ Dimension of a Service Covers roles and responsibilities, formal organizational structures, culture, and required staffing and competencies, all of which are related to the creation, delivery, and improvement of a service.The ‘Information and Technology’ Dimension Focuses on the information and knowledge necessary for the management of services, as well as the technologies required.The ‘Partners and Suppliers’ Dimension Focuses on the organization’s relationships with other organizations that are involved in the design, development, deployment, delivery, support, and/or continual improvement of services. This also incorporates contracts and other agreements between the organization and its partners or suppliers.Components of the Service Value System They are ‘guiding principles’, ‘governance’, ‘service value chain’, ‘practices’, and ‘continual improvement’.Service Value Chain Central element of the service value system and is an operating model outlining the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value realization through the creation and management of products and services.The ‘Plan’ Value Chain Activity Used to create a shared understanding of the vision, current status, and improvement direction for all four dimensions and all products and services across the organization.‘What is the Vision’ First Step of Continual Improvement Practice/Model Each improvement initiative should support the organization’s goals and objectives. it is important to identify the high-level direction of the initiative, but it is not important to define metrics, the current process, or the detailed steps of how to achieve your objective yet. Those all come in the later steps of the model.Normal Changes Changes which need to be scheduled, assessed, and authorized following a standard process. These changes are not considered routine (like a standard change). They are also not considered urgent and don’t need to be implemented as soon as possible to recover from an incident (like an emergency change).Emergency Change Change that must be implemented as soon as possible to resolve an incident or security issue.Change Schedule Used to help plan changes, assist in communication, avoid conflicts, and assign resources. By publishing the change schedule, everyone in the organization can know when a change is occurring, what people or components will be affected by the change, and when downtime or outages may occur. Change schedules are not used to develop features for a service.Problem Management Involves three distinct phases: problem identification, problem control, and error control.Workaround A solution that reduces or eliminates the impact of an incident or problem for which a full resolution is not yet available. Some workarounds reduce the likelihood of incidents.Service Level Agreements Used to measure the performance of services from a customer’s point of view. They may measure availability and capability, but only from the customer’s point of view." } ]
