## What is CJIS 

Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) is a division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that provides a range of criminal justice information services to law enforcement agencies in the United States. The CJIS Division maintains criminal justice databases and is responsible for setting and enforcing security policies and requirements for organizations that handle and maintain criminal justice information. CJIS compliance is mandatory for organizations that handle criminal justice information and failure to comply can result in penalties and loss of access to criminal justice information.

## CJIS Compliance

CJIS compliance refers to an organization's adherence to the security policies and requirements set forth by the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The CJIS Security Policy outlines a set of security requirements for organizations that handle and maintain criminal justice information, including law enforcement agencies, criminal justice agencies, and private sector partners.

To achieve CJIS compliance, organizations must implement appropriate security measures to protect criminal justice information from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. This includes implementing physical security measures, such as access controls and monitoring systems, as well as technical security measures, such as encryption and firewalls.

Organizations that are required to be compliant must also ensure that their personnel are properly trained on the security policies and procedures outlined in the CJIS Security Policy. This includes regular training on the proper handling and protection of criminal justice information, as well as ongoing awareness campaigns to promote good security practices.

It's mandatory for organizations that handle criminal justice information, and failure to comply can result in penalties and loss of access to criminal justice information. The CJIS Division regularly conducts audits of organizations to ensure compliance with the CJIS Security Policy, and organizations that fail to meet the requirements may be subject to corrective action or loss of access to criminal justice information.

## CJIS Audits

As part of its mission, CJIS conducts audits of organizations that handle and maintain criminal justice information to ensure compliance with the CJIS Security Policy.

A CJIS audit is a comprehensive review of an organization's policies, procedures, and security measures related to the handling, storage, and transmission of criminal justice information. The purpose of the audit is to ensure that organizations are taking appropriate measures to protect criminal justice information from unauthorized access or disclosure, which could compromise ongoing investigations or endanger public safety.

During an audit, an auditor from the FBI's CJIS Division will conduct a thorough review of the organization's security program, including policies, procedures, and training materials. The auditor will assess the organization's understanding and adherence to these policies and procedures, as well as conduct interviews with key personnel to gain insight into the organization's security practices.

The auditor will also conduct a physical security assessment of the organization's facilities, including data centers and storage areas, to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect criminal justice information from unauthorized access or theft. This may include reviewing security cameras, access control systems, and other security measures.

Additionally, the auditor will review the organization's IT systems and infrastructure to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place to protect against unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of criminal justice information. This may include reviewing network security controls, system access controls, and data encryption practices.

Once the audit is complete, the auditor will provide the organization with a report of their findings, including any deficiencies or areas for improvement. The organization will then have an opportunity to address any identified issues and implement corrective actions to address any deficiencies before the next audit.

By conducting regular audits of organizations that handle this sensitive information, the FBI's CJIS Division is able to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or theft. This, in turn, helps to promote public safety and ensure the integrity of the criminal justice system.

## Conclusion

By adhering to the security requirements outlined in the CJIS Security Policy, organizations can help to ensure that criminal justice information remains protected from unauthorized access or disclosure, and that the criminal justice system remains effective in promoting public safety.
