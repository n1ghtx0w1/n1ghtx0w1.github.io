## Getting Started -

There are many ways to break into tech.  My focus in this article is to provide some of the information that helped me along the way.

You have to start somewhere.  I’m not sure where you are in your journey for tech knowledge, or where you want to go.  I always suggest to start with looking at some jobs. For example:

- [Indeed - IT Remote Jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=IT&l=remote&from=search) 

- [Indeed - IT Entry Level Web Dev Jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=entry+level+web+developer&l=remote)

- [Indeed - Entry Level Cyber Security Remote Jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=entry+level+cyber+security&l=remote) 

 Examin the requirements for the jobs you look up.  Try various job boards.  Then start down a path focused on learning those skills by utilizing free resources ([Google](https://www.google.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) are great for this).  
 
 Depending what it is you want to learn there are also paid platforms like [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [AWS Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/?cta=tctopbanner), [Oracle University](https://mylearn.oracle.com/), [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), and so much more.

## What I Did (very short version) -

My situation and your situation are different so we can’t really compare what I did to how you decide to do it.    

I started with a lot of the above mentioned "free resources". What motivated my interest in learning was haacking, and there is a lot of research that goes into it.  A great platform to get started today that didn't exist when I began is [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/).  I started with [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). 

Then I moved onto Udemy for [Colt Steele’s Web Dev Bootcamp - Updated for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).  This came at the advice of [/r webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/) where I found many posts suggesting this course in opposition to a coding bootcamp.  Then I got into the A+, Network+, Security+, Cysa+, and you get the point.  I bought courses for around $10 each, and only bought when the sales came up.  

Over the years I've set up a lot of fun homelab projects.  I buy tech to tinker (when I was able to afford it).  I learned to step away from some biases.  An example bias being I never liked Apple phones, but I had to get one to learn iOS.  Linux looked complicated, but I had to just get in it to step away from years of Windows comfort.

Learning takes time.  It can be very frustrating, and you'll need patience.  Good sleep helps with figuring out issues.  There are times I go to bed thinking about something, and wake up with the solution.

## Closing Statement -

Getting past **HR** may require certifications and/or school.  I opted to enroll myself into [WGU](https://mbsy.co/66mVns) after a conversation with a recruiter.  I'd also make the point that most of the people I work with do not have an education; however, they have many more years of experience. Sometimes you have to go the extra mile to get what you want, and I wanted HR to pull my resume so I could get into interviews.  I’d still highly recommend learning what you can on your own before jumping onto any education platforms.  School isn’t for everyone, and WGU particularly.  Do a lot of research before you spend money.

Also, setup home labs and tinker.  Get some old PCs from eBay to break and fix.  You have to make time to learn.  Also, take care of your health both mental and physical.  I care enough about you to sit here and write this.  Now you have to start learning! :)
