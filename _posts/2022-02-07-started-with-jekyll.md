## Research
 
I was looking to create a blog style web page, and get accustomed to using Github more. I started with a simple “github blog” google search, and here we are. I figured someone may want some greater detail about this adventure.

I began with the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) documentation. Then I started into youtube videos. I’ll list some of the videos at the end of this article. Those videos led me to a resource that listed out Jekyll themes [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-theme-chirpy/), and Chirpy stood out to me. I began to mess with Chirpy by following the [Jekyll Theme Chirpy Starter], and again going over the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) documentation a second time.
 
Really I want to emphasize [making a blog with Jekyll theme chirpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUJ_PjfW2SE&t=1906s), because I ran into an issue.  Watching this video helped me resolve that issue. I don't recall the issue that I encountered unfortunately, but I certainly remember the video being of importance.

The docker video, [Host Your Own Blog with Jekyll, Docker, and GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHQ3IwIL590&t=359s), was something I used but not exactly necessary. I enjoy using containers, but it's not a requirement to do this. I just wanted to list the video, because I found it useful. I'll add the [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) documentation just in case anyone comes across this, and wants to dabble in that. I'm also using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), so I'll add that as well.

Finally, a big thanks to the [Jekyll Theme Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) team. I really enjoy using the theme, and enjoy the work the team put into it.
