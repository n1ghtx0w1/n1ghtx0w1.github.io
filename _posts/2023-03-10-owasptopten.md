## OWASP Top 10 2021: The Risks Associated With Each Vulnerability

### A01-2021: Broken Access Control

Broken access controls are a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application fails to properly enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions within the application. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to steal sensitive information, modify data, or perform other malicious actions within the application.

Common examples of broken access control include insecure direct object references, where an attacker is able to directly access and modify sensitive data without proper authorization, and insufficient authorization checks, where an attacker is able to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions by bypassing access control mechanisms.

To prevent broken access control vulnerabilities, developers should implement proper access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC), to ensure that users are only able to access the data and perform the actions that they are authorized to do so.

In addition, developers should use secure coding practices, such as input validation and output encoding, to prevent attackers from bypassing access control mechanisms through input manipulation or other methods.

Regular testing and monitoring of access controls can also help to identify and prevent broken access control vulnerabilities. This includes conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and taking steps to address any identified issues.

Broken access control vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the security of web applications, and developers and security professionals must take proactive steps to prevent these types of attacks by implementing proper security controls and best practices.

### A02-2021: Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic failures are security vulnerabilities that arise from weaknesses or flaws in cryptographic algorithms or implementations. Cryptography is the practice of using mathematical algorithms to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information transmitted over a network or stored on a computer system. Cryptographic failures can occur when encryption keys are compromised, when algorithms are weak, or when cryptographic protocols are implemented incorrectly.

**Examples of cryptographic failures include:**

- **Weak encryption algorithms:** Weak encryption algorithms such as DES or WEP are susceptible to brute-force attacks, which can allow an attacker to decrypt encrypted data.

- **Key management failures:** Cryptographic keys used for encryption and decryption are sensitive pieces of information that must be kept secure. Key management failures can occur when keys are not properly generated, stored, or destroyed.

- **Protocol weaknesses:** Cryptographic protocols such as SSL or TLS are designed to provide secure communication over a network. However, weaknesses in these protocols can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, which can allow an attacker to intercept and modify data in transit.

- **Side-channel attacks:** Cryptographic algorithms can sometimes leak information about the encrypted data through side-channels such as power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, or timing information. This can allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message from the ciphertext.

Developers and security professionals must implement strong encryption algorithms and protocols that are resistant to attacks. They must also implement proper key management practices to ensure that cryptographic keys are generated, stored, and destroyed securely. Additionally, regular testing and monitoring of cryptographic implementations can help to identify and prevent potential vulnerabilities.

Cryptographic failures can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other computer systems. By implementing strong encryption algorithms and protocols, properly managing cryptographic keys, and regularly testing and monitoring cryptographic implementations, organizations can reduce the risk of cryptographic failures and other security threats.

### A03-2021: Injection Attacks

Injection attacks are a type of security vulnerability that can have severe consequences if not properly addressed. Injection attacks occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious code or input into an application, with the intention of manipulating the behavior of the application.

The most common type of injection attack is a SQL injection, where an attacker injects SQL code into an input field of an application, such as a search bar or login field. The goal of an SQL injection attack is usually to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or to modify or delete data within the application's database.

Other types of injection attacks include LDAP injection, XPath injection, and OS command injection, where an attacker is able to manipulate the behavior of an application by injecting malicious input into fields that are used to execute LDAP, XPath or OS commands respectively.

The consequences of an injection attack can be significant, including data theft, data loss or corruption, unauthorized access, and system compromise. The impact of these attacks can be especially severe for applications that process sensitive data, such as financial or healthcare applications.

To prevent injection attacks, developers should use secure coding practices, such as input validation and parameterized queries, to ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated. In addition, applications should be regularly tested for vulnerabilities, and any identified vulnerabilities should be promptly addressed.

Injection attacks are a significant threat to the security of software applications, and developers and security professionals should take steps to mitigate the risk of these attacks by implementing proper security measures.

### A04-2021: Insecure Design

Insecure design vulnerabilities refer to security weaknesses that arise from poor design decisions or flawed architecture in software systems. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to exploit flaws in the design of the system to gain unauthorized access to data or carry out other malicious activities.

**Insecure design vulnerabilities include:**

- **Lack of input validation:** Applications that do not properly validate user input can be vulnerable to injection attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

- **Weak authentication and authorization mechanisms:** Applications that rely on weak authentication and authorization mechanisms can be vulnerable to attacks such as brute-force attacks or session hijacking.

- **Inadequate error handling:** Applications that do not properly handle errors can provide valuable information to attackers that can be used to carry out further attacks.

- **Insufficient separation of privileges:** Applications that do not separate privileges between different roles or users can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or carry out unauthorized actions.

To prevent this vulnerability, developers and security professionals must follow secure design principles and best practices when designing software systems. This includes properly validating all user input, implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, and properly handling errors.

Developers should conduct regular threat modeling exercises to identify potential vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security controls to mitigate them. This includes designing software systems with the principle of least privilege in mind, ensuring that privileges are separated between different roles and users.

Insecure design vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By following secure design principles and best practices, regularly conducting threat modeling exercises, and implementing appropriate security controls, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of insecure design vulnerabilities and other security threats.

### A05-2021: Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfigurations are a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an application or system is not configured properly, leaving it open to attacks or other security risks. This vulnerability can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as default configurations, outdated software, or improper settings.

Common examples of security misconfiguration include leaving default passwords or credentials in place, failing to apply security patches or updates to software, and leaving unnecessary services or ports open.

To prevent security misconfiguration vulnerabilities, developers and system administrators should follow secure configuration practices, such as applying security updates and patches in a timely manner, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, and disabling unnecessary services or ports.

In addition, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments can help to identify potential security misconfigurations and other vulnerabilities, allowing developers and administrators to take steps to address these issues before they can be exploited by attackers.

Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the security of web applications and systems, and developers and security professionals must take proactive steps to prevent these types of attacks by implementing proper security controls and best practices. By following secure configuration practices and regularly testing and monitoring systems for vulnerabilities, organizations can reduce the risk of security misconfiguration and other security threats.

### A06-2021: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Vulnerable and outdated components are security weaknesses that arise from the use of third-party software components with known security vulnerabilities or outdated versions of software components that are no longer supported by the vendor. These vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to exploit flaws in the components to gain unauthorized access to data or carry out other malicious activities.

**Vulnerable and outdated components include:**

- **Unpatched software vulnerabilities:** Applications that use outdated versions of software components with known security vulnerabilities are vulnerable to attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities.

- **Insecure libraries:** Applications that use insecure libraries, such as OpenSSL, that have known security vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to data.

- **Deprecated software:** Applications that use software that is no longer supported by the vendor, such as Windows XP, are vulnerable to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in the software.

To prevent this, developers and security professionals must monitor and maintain the software components used in their applications. This includes regularly updating and patching software components to address known vulnerabilities and ensuring that all components are still supported by the vendor.

Additionally, developers and/or development teams should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in their applications and take appropriate steps to mitigate them. This may include removing insecure or unnecessary components, upgrading to newer versions of components, or implementing additional security controls to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

This type of vulnerability can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By monitoring and maintaining the software components used in their applications, regularly updating and patching components, and conducting regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of vulnerable and outdated components and other security threats.

## A10-2021: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a type of web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to send unauthorized requests from a vulnerable server to other internal or external systems. SSRF attacks can be used to bypass security controls, access sensitive information, or carry out further attacks on other systems.

SSRF attacks typically involve exploiting web application functionality that allows the application to send requests to other systems. This functionality can be used by an attacker to send requests to internal systems, such as databases or other backend servers, or to external systems, such as cloud services or other web applications.

Examples of SSRF vulnerabilities include:

- **Malicious URL redirection:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that redirects the vulnerable server to a target system, allowing the attacker to access sensitive information or carry out further attacks.

- **Request smuggling:** An attacker can manipulate the HTTP request headers to trick the vulnerable server into sending requests to other systems.

- **Proxy abuse:** An attacker can use the vulnerable server as a proxy to access other systems, bypassing any security controls in place.

To prevent these attacks, developers should implement strong input validation and output encoding mechanisms to prevent attackers from injecting malicious requests into the web application. This may include implementing a whitelist of allowed URLs or IP addresses, using DNS resolution to validate external URLs, and restricting access to internal systems.

Also, developers should conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities and take appropriate steps to mitigate them. This may include implementing additional security controls, such as web application firewalls or network segmentation, to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive systems.

SSRF attacks can have severe consequences for the security of web applications and other software systems. By implementing strong security controls, adhering to industry best practices, and conducting regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, developers and security professionals can reduce the risk of SSRF attacks and other security threats.
