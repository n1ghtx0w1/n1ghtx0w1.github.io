## The New Domain - 

Last year was fantastic for career growth and development.  I plan to rock harder in 2023, and thus the new domain.  

Looking to tackle more security projects and document them right here.

My most recent project involves [proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/), logging, and analytics. I’ll post an update soon for others to check it out.
