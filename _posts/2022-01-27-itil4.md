The ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a framework designed to standardize the selection, planning, delivery, maintenance, and overall lifecycle of IT (information technology) services within a business. The goal is to improve efficiency and achieve predictable service delivery.

Below I will layout some of my notes, but first I wanted to thank my course instructor for the Pluralsight tests, my mentor for keeping on me, and the `accountability` group from the `Cyber Security Club` for keeping me on task.

> *Numeric value inside of (), for each category, indicates how many questions are to be expected on the test from each section. For example "Key Concepts and Definitions" have (5) questions expected on the exam.*

## Key Concepts and Definitions (5) 

**Service Management** *- A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value to customers in the form of services*

**Value** *- The perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something*

**Customer** *- Defines requirements for services*

**User** *- A person who uses the service*

**Sponsor** *- Authorizes budgets for services*

**Supplier** *- External partner who provides services to the organization*

**Organizations** *- A group of people that has its own functions, responsibilities and authorities to achieve specific objectives*

 **Service** *- The means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks*

**Product** *- A configuration of resources, created by the organization that will be potentially valuable to customers*
 
**Service Offering** *- A specific mix of services and products sold to a specific customer*
>
> **Goods** *- ownership is transferred to customer* 
>
> **Access to resources** *- customer is allowed to use it*
>
> **Service Actions** *- things the service provider does for the customer*
>
---

**Output** *- A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity*

**Outcome** *- A result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs*

**Cost** *- Can be removed from the customer (part of value proposition), and can be imposed on the customer (price for service consumption)*

**Risk** *- uncertainty of outcome.  Can be good (opportunity) or bad (hazard)*

**Utility** *- Fit for purpose.  Service does what it is meant to do*

**Warranty** *- Fit for use. Is the service availability, capacity, continuity, and security good enough? Customer defines this!*

## The Service Value System (1)

The Service value system converts opportunity and demand by applying our own service management magic into actual value for our customers.

## The Guiding Principles (6)
 
*Recommendations that guide organizations in any circumstances, even for implementing ITIL 4*
 
- **Focus on Value**
  - Everything you do must be somehow (directly or indirectly) valuable to your stakeholders.
- **Start Where You Are**
  - Reuse existing resources whenever possible instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again.
- **Progress Iteratively With Feedback**
  - Don't do everything at once, take baby steps instead. Learning by doing with lots of feedback.
- **Collaborate and Promote Visibility**
  - Involve the right people at the right time and gather factual data to make the right decisions.  
- **Think and Work Holistically**
  - Nothing is ever alone. Think about the effect of your initiative or work on other components.
- **Keep it Simple and Practical**
  - Don’t overcomplicate work. Use the least possible steps. Outcome based thinking helps.
- **Optimize and Automate** 
  - Maximize the value of human work. Automate only after optimization.  Apply DevOps.

*Summary of the guiding principles*

- *Universally applicable to any work or initiative*

- *Represent well-proven, good practice*

- *Are neither prescriptive nor a must*

- *Can be applied stand-alone but are better in conjunction* 

- *Have a strong relation to Lean-Agile thinking*

## The Service Value Chain (2)

The service value chain is a part of the service value system, and is an operating model which utilizes value streams. It has 6 different activities that `transforms demand into value`.
 
Value Stream:
- A series of steps an organization takes to co-create value with customers.
- These steps can be mapped to the SVC (service value chain) in any combination.
- E.g. handling of incidents or developing new applications.
Value streams are focused on mapping the steps that are needed, and trying to find improvement opportunities in these steps. Find waste and eliminate it, and optimize flow to achieve value.

Purpose of the Activities

**Plan**
- Ensures shared understanding of vision, current status and direction

**Improve**
- Continual improvement of products and services

**Engage**
- Understand stakeholder needs and demands

**Design and transition**
- Make sure that services meet stakeholder needs

**Obtain or build**
- Ensure components are available when needed

**Deliver and support**
- Ensure SLA (service level agreement) conform service delivery

_**The service value chain**_
- **Is an operating model**
- **Outlines activities needed to transform demand into value**
- **`Universally applicable`**
- **Can be used for mapping Value Streams**
- **Practices include specific sequences of SVC activities**

## Most Important Practices (19)

- A practice is a set of organizational resources designed to perform work or accomplish an objective.

>  **`General Management`** | **`Service Management`** | **`Technical Management`**
>  **Continual Improvement** | **Change Enablement**| Deployment Management  
>  Information Security Management | **Incident Management** |
>  Relationship management | IT Asset Management |  
>  Supplier Management | Monitoring & Event Management |
>   | **Problem Management** |
>   | Release Management |
>   | Service Configuration Management |
>   | **Service Desk** |
>   | **Service Level Management** |
>   | **Service Request Management** |

**!Continual Improvement `is a practice!`**

<img align="right" src="https://www.qrpinternational.ch/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/08/itil-continual-improvement-model.jpg" alt="CyberWar" width="400" height="200">

- Continual improvement happens everywhere in the organization (SVS, SVC, practices).
- Ideas need to be reprioritized when new ones are added.
- It is a responsibility of everyone.
- Organizations may have Continual Improvement Team for better coordination.
- All 4 Dimensions need to be considered during any improvement initiative.

**What is the vision?**
- Align the mission and vision of improvement with the orginization. 

**Where are we now?**
- Starting point of our journey (guiding principal “start where you are”) where you are now.

**Where do we want to be?**
- Short term targets we need to achieve. Measurable targets (SMART Specifici, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timebound).

**How do we get there?**
- How do we want to achieve our measurable targets? Agile, waterfall, setup teams, and projects.

**Take action**
- Make sure we act on our plan of improvement.

**Did we get there?**
- Did we achieve our goal and what lessons were learned? 

**How do we keep the momentum going?**
- Make sure we are continuing to improve and not going back to old habbits.

**!Change Enablement**
 
**Purpose:** *maximize the number of successful changes through proper risk assessment and minimize the negative impact of failed changes.*
 
**Types:**
- **Standard:** *Pre-authorized, low risk, low cost, basically Service Requests.*
 
- **Normal:** *Authorization depends on what kind of change it is. Goes through the normal change workflow.*
 
- **Emergency:** *Needs rapid action. May have a separate change authority.*

**!Incident Management**
 
**Purpose:** *minimize negative impact of incidents by restoring normal operation as soon as possible.*
 
- **Incident:** *unplanned interruption or reduction of quality. Must be logged, prioritized, and managed throughout their lifecycle. Uses the same categorizations as problem tickets. Swarming may help with complex issues.*
 
- **Major Incidents:** *need a separate procedure. Swarming can be used for faster solutions.*

**!Problem Management**

 **Purpose:** *reduce likelihood of recurring incidents by identifying root causes and eliminating them.*
 
- **Problem:** Unknown cause of one or more incidents.
- **Known Error:** A problem with a known root case but no solution yet.
- **Workaround:** Alternate solution, reducing the impact of the problem.
 
**Phases:** Problem Identification > Problem Control > Error Control

**!Service Desk**
 
**Purpose:** *capture demand for the incidents and service requests.  Single point of contact between service provider and users.*
 
Issues request queries > SPOC > Acknowledge > Classify > Own > Act
 
**Channels:**

E-Mail | Self-Service 
Phone | Text Messaging
Chat | Forums
 
**Skills:**

- Incident analysis and prioritization
- Effective communication
- Emotional intelligence
- Excellent customer service skills

**!Service Level Management** 
 
**Purpose:** *to set clear business-based targets for service performance, so that the delivery of a service can be measured properly.* 
 
**SLA:** Service Level Agreement between customer, and service providers.
**OLA:** Operational Level Agreement between different units of the same organization.
**UC:** Underpinning Contracts are an agreement between service provider and external supplier.
 
**Recommendations:**

- CLear language, no jargon 
- Should relate to defined outcomes
- Simply written, easy to understand 
- Listen actively to customer needs

**!Service Request Management**
 
**Purpose:** *to support the agreed quality of services by handling all pre-defined, user initiated service requests.*
 
**Service Request:** a formal request for something other than incident resolution (e.g. information, advice, how-to questions…)
 
Steps to fulfill requests should be `well known` (for both simple and complex requests).

When defining new workflows, try to `reuse` already existing ones. 

User expectations must be managed in regards of what can be delivered.

**SUMMARY**
 
_**Practices**_

Formerly known as processes | Continual Improvement
More comprehensive view | Change Enablement
Include the 4 Dimensions | Incident Management 
Have specific goals | Problem Management 
Support SVC activities | Service Desk
| Service Level Management
| Service Request Management 

## Other Examinable Practices (5)
 
**Information Security Management** *Protects information needed by organizations to conduct business.*
 
_**Ensures appropriate levels of:**_
