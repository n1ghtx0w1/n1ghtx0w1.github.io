## Background -

I consider myself very fortunate.  Not because where I am in life, but how I got there. What I had to go through to get here.  

I’m a disability retired police officer.  My path into tech wasn’t easy.  It was hard to get back on my feet, and I’m lucky to be here today to write about it.  

I had to handle a lot of personal problems after ending my first career.  I'm sure there are many great quotes to insert here, so I'll just emphasize that I understand struggle.  I had to really want to be successful again in my life or I wouldn’t be here, and that may apply to anyone else reading this.  I can absolutely relate, if changing careers is going to help you with pain or depression.  Feel free to contact me:

`Important:` *I take suicide and depression very seriously.  If you're struggling please get help.  Your life matters!*

## Getting Started -

There are many ways to break into tech, and a lot of content that already details all the different ways.  My focus in this article is to provide some of the information that helped me along the way.

You have to start somewhere.  I’m not sure where you are with tech knowledge or where you want to go.  Start with looking at jobs, and the requirements for those jobs.  Then start down a path learning those skills utilizing free resources (Google, Youtube, and Reddit are great for this).  Depending what it is you want to learn there are also paid platforms like Udemy, Coursera, AWS Training, Oracle University, LinkedIn Learning, and so much more.

## What I Did (very short version) -

My situation and your situation are different so we can’t really compare what I did to how you decide to do it.    

I started with a lot of google and youtube. What motivated my interest in learning was haacking, and there is so much research that goes into it.  A great platform to get started today that didn't exist when I began is [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/).  I started with [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) myself.

Then I moved onto Udemy for Colt Steele’s Web Dev Bootcamp which also led me into the A+, Network +, Security +, Cysa +, and you get the point.  I bought courses for around $10 each, and only bought when the sales came up.  Then I pursued certifications and a degree.  I want to stress that certifications or a degree are not always required, but I had a gap in my work history that plagued me.

Over the years I've set up a lot of fun homelab projects.  I buy tech to tinker (when I was able to afford it).  I learned to step away from some biases.  An example bias being I never liked Apple phones, but I had to get one to learn iOS.  Linux looked complicated, but I had to just get in it to step away from years of Windows comfort.

Learning takes time.  It can be very frustrating, and you'll need patience.  Good sleep is also a major help in figuring out issues.  There are a lot of times I go to bed thinking about something, and wake up with the solution.

## Closing Statements -

Setup home labs and tinker.  Get some old PCs from eBay to break and fix.  You have to make time to learn.  Also, take care of your health both mental and physical.  I care enough about you to sit here and write this.  Now you have to start learning! :)
