**25 Pin D Sub**
- A legacy connector with a D sub parallel port, it was used primarily with printers.

**VGA**
- A legacy connector consisting of 3 rows of 5 pins each with a D sub connector, it was used for monitors or projectors.

**Power Supply**
- This box takes standard household current and converts it to either 5v or 12v DC. It is used to power the system unit.

**Video Card**
- a printed circuit board controlling output to a display screen, it is used to render graphics from a simple GUI to a complex 3d game. The more powerful the card, the better the application that it can render.

**RAM Stick**
- These cards hold the computer memory. Any active program, such as the OS, a game, or application, is stored here for quick access by the processor.

**CPU**
- This is the brains of a computer. It handles every process that goes through from the hard drive to the motherboard, managing every element of a computer.
- Central Processing Unit

**AMD, Intel**
- Two of the largest CPU manufacturers

**Motherboard**
- Every piece of the computer is connected either directly or indirectly together from this central point. It is where the CPU is located, controlling every element of the computer.

**Optical Drive**
- These play disk media, such as CD's, DVD's, or blu-ray disks, or some can copy data to special disks in the form of burning data. It uses a laser to read the data on the disk.

**Hard Drive**
- This uses platters to store data by means of magnetic force. It uses actuator arms to record the data to the platters. It is where every element of a program is permanently stored until otherwise deleted by the user, or by accidental means.

**Solid State Drive**
- This uses semiconductors to store data as electronic means. It uses no moving parts, and can be generally quicker than the platter variants. Like it's cousin, every element of a program is stored permanently here, until otherwise deleted by the user, by accidental means, or simply by conductor burnout.

**CPU-Z**
- This program is available free on the internet. It allows the user to see the specifications of their computer, from the CPU to the GPU.

**Hertz**
- This is the term used for Cycle per second.

**Giga**
- This is the term used for Billion, will also be found in combination with other terms.

**System Crystal**
- A small, tiny quartz crystal located near the CPU that regulates the general speed of the CPU and the overall system.

**3.5 ghz**
- Modern CPU's do not run much faster than this maximum speed. It is possible, but very expensive to do.

**RAM**
- Random Access Memory
- Adding this to a system can greatly increase performance.

**DRAM**
- Dynamic Random Access Memory

**SDRAM**
- Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory
- This type of RAM uses a 168 pin DIMM. It also has 2 notches in it to lock into a MoBo. It is synchronized to the system clock. It used clock speed, which must be matched to the MoBo. Generally it came with a PC rating to match the MoBo. It can still be used in some systems today. It is generally characterized by a double or triple digit PC rating.

**DIMM**
- Dual In-line Memory Module

**DDR**
- Dual Data Rate

**DDR SDRAM**
- This type of RAM uses a 184 pin DIMM. It only has a single notch to match into a MoBo. It was capable of doubling a motherboard clock speed, making the RAM faster. It is generally characterized by 4 digit PC numbers. To calculate speeds, DDR will double the MoBo speeds. For example, 100 MHz becomes 200, 200 MHz becomes 400.

**x8**
- You will take a DDR speed and multiply it by this. For example, if a system is 100 Mhz and DDR SDRAM multiplied the speed to 200 MHz, you would multiply by this number to get the PC rating speed.

**DDR2**
- This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like it's lesser counterpart, it uses a single slot to match a MoBo, however it is in a different location, preventing insertion into the wrong MoBo. It not only doubled the speeds like DDR, it also doubled the clock speeds. To calculate speeds, you will double the MoBo speed, then double the number again. The PC rating will have a PC2 number.

**DDR3**
- This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like it's counterpart, it also uses a single slot, but it is also located in a different location to prevent insertion into the wrong slots. To calculate the speed, you calculate the MoBo speed x4. Then you will double that speed to get the actual speed of this RAM. This PC rating will have a PC3 number.

**Rambus RAM**
- Characterized by a 184 pin RIMM, this type of RAM is long obsolete. It also has 2 notches to prevent insertion into the wrong MoBo. This type of RAM must always be installed in pairs.

**CRIMM**
- Continuity RIMM
- When installing Rambus RAM modules, this type of stick must always be installed in the empty sockets. It does not have a function other than to terminate.

**Single Sided RAM**
- This type of RAM only has memory on one side of a stick.

**Double Sided RAM**
- This type of RAM has memory on both sides of a stick.

**ECC and parity RAM**
- This type of RAM has extra chips designed for error correcting. It can only be used on MoBo's that accept this type of RAM. Generally it is only located on servers.

**SODIMM**
- Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module
- This type of RAM is only used in laptop systems. It has slightly lower capacity than it's counterparts, however other than that feature it is nearly identical, except for it being smaller. It comes in 100, 144, 200 pins. 204 pins is unique to DDR3 ram.

**SPD**
- Serial Presence Detect

**MTBF**
- Mean Time Between Failures

**Memtest86**
- A program available for users who have less than Windows 7, this program must be boot into to use, either with optical media or a flash drive. It enables the user to test the RAM of their system for consistency and failures.

**Windows Memory Diagnostic**
- This program comes with every windows 7 and later system. It is located under Administration Tools and helps to diagnose any issues related to memory.

**Software**
- These types of programs are stored on harddrives. They can be changed as often as wanted.

**Firmware**
- These types of programs are stored on chips. They are semi-permanent or permanent programs that enable the system to communicate.

**CMOS**
- Complimentary Metal Oxide Semi-conductor

**System BIOS**
- This program is stored on a ROM chip, it enables all of the hardware to communicate to eachother.
