## STIG Solutions [NG]

**Author:** Alexander Hillock

**Framework Category:** Operate and Maintain

**Specialty Area:** Systems Analysis

**Work Role:** Systems Security Analyst

**Task Description:** Implement security measures to resolve vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and recommend security changes to system or system components as needed. (T0485)

## Scenario

After a review, I was made aware that some of our computers are not up to security configuration standards, leaving the machines open to multiple vulnerabilities that could be catastrophic if exploited. I need you to configure specific machines to comply with specific configurations found in DISA's (Defense Information Systems Agency) Security Technical Implementation Guide.

_**Additional Information**_

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.

You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.

Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...
Username: playerone
Password: password123

The username/password used to access the Firewall's web interface within the workspace will be the following...
Username: admin
Password: password123

## Mission Start

I began work on this challenge on 5 MAR 2022, at at 15:45 hours, with the following meeting:

>**Gary Thatcher:**
>
>@playerone, It looks like some of our machines aren't as secure as we might have thought, there is some configuration I'd like you to perform on the Prod-Web machine to close up some of the holes that are there.
>    
>**Ione Leventis:**
>
>I've done some research for a good configuration guide and I've found something called a Security Technical Implementation Guide. I've gone ahead and dropped both the guide and the viewing tool on the Security-Desk. You should make sure the machine is configured with some of the CAT II specifications. Specifically, I have a range of the CAT II configs I'll want you to implement.
>
>**Richard LeGrand:**
>
>WE HAVE VULNERABILITIES??!!! WHAT IS GOING ON??? GET THIS FIXED....YESTERDAY!!!!!!
>
>**Ione Leventis:**
>
>For now, I want you fix any findings you come accross within the range of rule 13 (V-204406) through rule 31 (V-204426). Just make sure you're filtering via only CAT II rules. However, if you come accross any user specific fixes, please leave the nagios account alone, otherwise our MSP wont be able to monitor our environment anymore and that will cause a lot headaches for everyone.
>
>**Ione Leventis:**
>
>Oh, and make sure you don't unzip the Red Hat Enterprise Linux STIG, just import it straight into the viewer itself. I know our Prod-Web is CentOS 7 but the rules I need you to cover will still apply. Keep in mind the STIG and STIG Viewer are both located on the Security-Desk, however the issues you will be solving are on Prod-Web.

Add the following line in "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" (or modify the line to have the required value):

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/pam.d/password-auth
```

**password requisite pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok remember=5 retry=3**

`Note:` Manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the "authconfig" program. The "authconfig" program should not be used to update the configurations listed in this requirement.

### Vul ID V-204423

**Check Text:** Verify the operating system enforces a minimum 15-character password length. The "minlen" option sets the minimum number of characters in a new password.

Check for the value of the "minlen" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:

```shell
$ grep minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf
```

**minlen = 15**

If the command does not return a "minlen" value of 15 or greater, this is a finding.

**Fix Text:** Configure operating system to enforce a minimum 15-character password length.

Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/security/pwquality.conf
```

**minlen = 15**

### Vul ID V-204424

**Check Text:** To verify that null passwords cannot be used, run the following command: 

```shell
$ grep nullok /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth
```

If this produces any output, it may be possible to log on with accounts with empty passwords.

If null passwords can be used, this is a finding.

**Fix Text:** If an account is configured for password authentication but does not have an assigned password, it may be possible to log on to the account without authenticating.

Remove any instances of the **"nullok"** option in "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" to prevent logons with empty passwords.

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/pam.d/system-auth
```

`Note:` Manual changes to the listed files may be overwritten by the "authconfig" program. The "authconfig" program should not be used to update the configurations listed in this requirement.

### Vul ID V-204425

**Check Text:** To determine how the SSH daemon's "PermitEmptyPasswords" option is set, run the following command:

```shell
$ grep -i PermitEmptyPasswords /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**PermitEmptyPasswords no**

If no line, a commented line, or a line indicating the value "no" is returned, the required value is set.

If the required value is not set, this is a finding.

**Fix Text:** To explicitly disallow remote logon from accounts with empty passwords, add or correct the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config":

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**PermitEmptyPasswords no**

The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect. Any accounts with empty passwords should be disabled immediately, and PAM configuration should prevent users from being able to assign themselves empty passwords.

### Vul ID V-204426

**Check Text:** If passwords are not being used for authentication, this is Not Applicable.

Verify the operating system disables account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) after the password expires with the following command:

```shell
$ grep -i inactive /etc/default/useradd
```

**INACTIVE=35**

If "INACTIVE" is set to "-1", a value greater than "35", is commented out, or is not defined, this is a finding.

**Fix Text:** Configure the operating system to disable account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices) 35 days after the password expires.

Add the following line to "/etc/default/useradd" (or modify the line to have the required value):

```shell
$ sudo vim /etc/default/useradd
```

**INACTIVE=35**

DoD recommendation is 35 days, but a lower value is acceptable. The value "-1" will disable this feature, and "0" will disable the account immediately after the password expires.

I completed my task by setting the rules according to **U_RHEL_7_V3R6_STIG** for the prod-web server as requested.

Each NICE Challenge has the following core elements: a narrative-driven scenario, a business environment (workspace), and a set of technical objectives and/or a written deliverable. Each of these elements is developed to immerse the player (student) in a real-world experience and create a valuable set of data allowing their curator (educator) to judge their readiness for the workforce.
