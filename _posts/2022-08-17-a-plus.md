`In progress`

The **CompTIA A+** is the only industry recognized credential with performance testing to prove pros can think on their feet to perform critical IT support tasks. It is trusted by employers around the world to identify the go-to person in end point management & technical support roles. CompTIA A+ appears in more tech support job listings than any other IT credential. 

The CompTIA A+ Core Series requires candidates to pass two exams: **Core 1 (220-1101)** and **Core 2 (220-1102)** covering the following new content, emphasizing the technologies and skills IT pros need to support a hybrid workforce. 

### [About CompTIA A+ Certification](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) 


## Getting Started

I utilized **Udemy**, **Pluralsight**, and **YouTube** videos to ***listen*** to the information first. 

Practice tests helped me gage my weak points and focus my studying efforts.

The **CertMaster** resource below offers labs, videos, practice exams, domain reviews, and a final practice exam. This resource is probably really good for those who are completly new to tech or lacking experience.

**Professor Messer** comes highly recommended and for good reason. The course notes and study videos are fantastic!

**Ethernet**
- This port is used primarily with wired networks, using an 8-pin RJ-45 connector.

**ESATA**
- This port is used almost exclusively with external hard drives.

**S/PDIF**
- This port is supported by fiber optic cabling, occasionally by a coaxial-type connector that screws on. It is used for audio transfer.

**DVI**
- This port is used for monitors or projectors.

**HDMI**
- This port is used for both audio and video, connecting to televisions or any type of media receiver.

**1/8 Inch Mini RCA Jack**

**25 Pin D Sub**
- A legacy connector with a D sub parallel port, it was used primarily with printers.

**VGA**
- A legacy connector consisting of 3 rows of 5 pins each with a D sub connector, it was used for monitors or projectors.

**Power Supply**
- This box takes standard household current and converts it to either 5v or 12v DC. It is used to power the system unit.

**Video Card**
- a printed circuit board controlling output to a display screen, it is used to render graphics from a simple GUI to a complex 3d game. The more powerful the card, the better the application that it can render.

**RAM Stick**
- These cards hold the computer memory. Any active program, such as the OS, a game, or application, is stored here for quick access by the processor.

**CPU**
- This is the brains of a computer. It handles every process that goes through from the hard drive to the motherboard, managing every element of a computer.
- Central Processing Unit

**AMD, Intel**
- Two of the largest CPU manufacturers

**Motherboard**
- Every piece of the computer is connected either directly or indirectly together from this central point. It is where the CPU is located, controlling every element of the computer.

**Optical Drive**
- These play disk media, such as CD's, DVD's, or blu-ray disks, or some can copy data to special disks in the form of burning data. It uses a laser to read the data on the disk.

**Hard Drive**
- This uses platters to store data by means of magnetic force. It uses actuator arms to record the data to the platters. It is where every element of a program is permanently stored until otherwise deleted by the user, or by accidental means.

**Solid State Drive**
- This uses semiconductors to store data as electronic means. It uses no moving parts, and can be generally quicker than the platter variants. Like it's cousin, every element of a program is stored permanently here, until otherwise deleted by the user, by accidental means, or simply by conductor burnout.

**CPU-Z**
- This program is available free on the internet. It allows the user to see the specifications of their computer, from the CPU to the GPU.

**Hertz**
- This is the term used for Cycle per second.

**Giga**

**LGA 2011**
- This replaced the LGA 1366 sockets. More higher end, it started out with DDR3 support, but moved to DD4. These sockets only supported PCI-E. Names include the Core I3, I5, and I7.

**LGA 1150**
- More mainstream socket, it supports multiple CPU's, Started with DDR3 support, then DDR4, and can support a very large amount of PCI-E Devices.

**RAM**
- Random Access Memory
- Adding this to a system can greatly increase performance.

**DRAM**
- Dynamic Random Access Memory

**SDRAM**
- Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory
- This type of RAM uses a 168 pin DIMM. It also has 2 notches in it to lock into a MoBo. It is synchronized to the system clock. It used clock speed, which must be matched to the MoBo. Generally it came with a PC rating to match the MoBo. It can still be used in some systems today. It is generally characterized by a double or triple digit PC rating.

**DIMM**
- Dual In-line Memory Module

**DDR**
- Dual Data Rate

**DDR SDRAM**
- This type of RAM uses a 184 pin DIMM. It only has a single notch to match into a MoBo. It was capable of doubling a motherboard clock speed, making the RAM faster. It is generally characterized by 4 digit PC numbers. To calculate speeds, DDR will double the MoBo speeds. For example, 100 MHz becomes 200, 200 MHz becomes 400.

**x8**
- You will take a DDR speed and multiply it by this. For example, if a system is 100 Mhz and DDR SDRAM multiplied the speed to 200 MHz, you would multiply by this number to get the PC rating speed.

**DDR2**
- This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like it's lesser counterpart, it uses a single slot to match a MoBo, however it is in a different location, preventing insertion into the wrong MoBo. It not only doubled the speeds like DDR, it also doubled the clock speeds. To calculate speeds, you will double the MoBo speed, then double the number again. The PC rating will have a PC2 number.

**DDR3**
- This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like it's counterpart, it also uses a single slot, but it is also located in a different location to prevent insertion into the wrong slots. To calculate the speed, you calculate the MoBo speed x4. Then you will double that speed to get the actual speed of this RAM. This PC rating will have a PC3 number.

**Rambus RAM**
- Characterized by a 184 pin RIMM, this type of RAM is long obsolete. It also has 2 notches to prevent insertion into the wrong MoBo. This type of RAM must always be installed in pairs.

**CRIMM**
- Continuity RIMM
- When installing Rambus RAM modules, this type of stick must always be installed in the empty sockets. It does not have a function other than to terminate.

**Single Sided RAM**
- This type of RAM only has memory on one side of a stick.

**Double Sided RAM**
- This type of RAM has memory on both sides of a stick.

**ECC and parity RAM**
- This type of RAM has extra chips designed for error correcting. It can only be used on MoBo's that accept this type of RAM. Generally it is only located on servers.

**SODIMM**
- Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module
- This type of RAM is only used in laptop systems. It has slightly lower capacity than it's counterparts, however other than that feature it is nearly identical, except for it being smaller. It comes in 100, 144, 200 pins. 204 pins is unique to DDR3 ram.

**SPD**
- Serial Presence Detect

**MTBF**
- Mean Time Between Failures

**Memtest86**
- A program available for users who have less than Windows 7, this program must be boot into to use, either with optical media or a flash drive. It enables the user to test the RAM of their system for consistency and failures.

**Windows Memory Diagnostic**
- This program comes with every windows 7 and later system. It is located under Administration Tools and helps to diagnose any issues related to memory.

**Software**
- These types of programs are stored on harddrives. They can be changed as often as wanted.

**Firmware**
- These types of programs are stored on chips. They are semi-permanent or permanent programs that enable the system to communicate.

**CMOS**
- Complimentary Metal Oxide Semi-conductor

**System BIOS**
- This program is stored on a ROM chip, it enables all of the hardware to communicate to eachother.

## Hardware and Network Troubleshooting (29%)

### The CompTIA troubleshooting methodology:

  - 1. Identify the problem
  - 2. Establish a theory of probable cause
  - 3. Test the theory to determine the cause
  - 4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
  - 5. Verify full system functionality, and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
  - 6. Document findings, actions and outcomes

#### Identify the Problem

Identification is often the easiest step. It may be accomplished via an inbound phone call from a user, a help desk ticket, an email message, a log file entry or any number of other sources. It is not at all uncommon for users to alert you to the problem.

It’s important to recognize that the root cause of specific issues is not always apparent. For example, a failed login attempt might seem to indicate a username or password problem, when instead the real issue may be a lack of network connectivity that prevents the authentication information from being checked against a remote server.

As troubleshooters, we want to be very careful to ensure we have identified the root cause of the error, misconfiguration or service interruption before making any changes.

Specific steps here may include:

  - Gathering information from log files and error messages
  - Questioning users
  - Identifying symptoms
  - Determining recent changes
  - Duplicating the problem
  - Approaching multiple problems one at a time
  - Narrowing the scope of the problem

#### Establish a Theory of Probable Cause

I’d like to start by pointing out the impreciseness of the words in this step. Words such as theory and probable indicate a guess on your part, even if it is a guess backed by data. The way this step is written acknowledges that the root cause (step one) may not have been accurately identified. However, the cause is specific enough to begin troubleshooting.

This stage may require significant research on your part. Vendor documentation, your organization’s own documentation and a good old-fashioned Google search may all be required to provide the basis for your theory.

Specific steps here may include:

  - Questioning the obvious
  - Considering multiple approaches, including top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top for layered technologies (such as networks)

One of the main issues that I’ve observed with newer troubleshooters is failing to question the obvious. In my classes, I rephrase this as “start simple and work toward the complex.” Yes, I am aware that operating systems, networks and cloud deployments are all very complex. However, that does not mean that your issue is complex.

I have found over the years that careful note-taking is important at this point. Your notes can include data copied from websites, web URLs, suggestions from your team members, etc.

#### Test the Theory to Determine the Cause

What’s most interesting about the first two steps is that they don’t require you to make configuration changes. Changes should not be made until you are reasonably sure you have a solution that you’re ready to implement.

This step is also part of the “information-gathering” phase.

Please note, it is not uncommon for experienced administrators to move very quickly and informally through steps one, two and three. Problems and symptoms are often familiar, making it simple to predict the likely cause of an error message or failed device.

At this stage, you may find yourself circling all the way back to step one: Identify the problem. If you test your theory to discover the likely cause and find that you were incorrect, you may need to start your research all over again. You can check in with users, dig more deeply into log files, exercise your Google-Fu, etc.

Once you’re confident you’ve found the fundamental issue, the next step is to prepare to solve the problem.

#### Establish a Plan of Action and Implement the Solution

If you believe you know the root cause of the troubleshooting issue, you can now plan how to address it. Here are some reasons to plan ahead before blindly jumping into a course of action:

  - Some fixes require reboots or other more significant forms of downtime
  - You may need to download software, patches, drivers or entire operating system files before proceeding
  - Your change management procedures may require you to test modifications to a system’s configuration in a staging environment before implementing the fix in production
  - You may need to document a series of complex steps, commands and scripts
  - You may need to back up data that might be put at risk during the recovery
  - You may need approval from other IT staff members before making changes

Once you’ve completed this stage, you’re now ready to do whatever it is you believe you need to do to solve the problem. These steps may include:

  - Run your scripts
  - Update your systems or software
  - Edit configuration files
  - Change firewall settings

Make sure that you have a rollback plan in place in case the fix you’re attempting does not address the issue. You must be able to reverse your settings to at least get back to where you began.

In some cases, implementing the proposed fix may be quicker than the research phases that preceded it. Those research phases are essential, however, to make sure you’re addressing the real issue and to minimize downtime.

#### Verify Full System Functionality and Implement Preventive Measures

I once observed a failure at this very stage of troubleshooting. The support person in question was called to investigate a printer that wasn’t working. When he arrived, he noticed the printer was unplugged. He plugged it back in, grumbled about users not understanding computers, and walked away. What he failed to realize, however, was that the printer was jammed and that the users had unplugged it while attempting to fix the jam. The tech walked away without verifying functionality.

When possible, have the users that rely on the system test functionality for you. They are the ones that really know how the system is supposed to act and they can ensure that it responds to their specific requirements.

Depending on the problem, you may need to apply the fix to multiple servers or other devices. For example, if you’ve discovered a problem with a device driver on a server, you may need to update the drivers on several servers that rely on the same device.

#### Document Findings

Documentation is a pet peeve of mine. It comes from working as a network administrator for an organization that had zero documentation. I was the sixth administrator the company had hired in five years, and no one before me wrote down anything. It was a nightmare.

Documenting your troubleshooting steps, changes, updates, theories and research could all be useful in the future when a similar problem arises (or when the same problem turns out not to have been fixed after all).

Another reason to keep good documentation as you go through the entire methodology is to communicate to others what you have tried so far. I was on the phone once with Microsoft tech support for a failed Exchange server. The first thing the tech said was, “What have you tried so far?” I had a three-page list of things we didn’t need to try again.

Such documentation is also useful in case your changes had unintended consequences. You are more easily able to reverse your changes or change configurations if you have good documentation on exactly what you did.

### Troubleshooting

On a personal computer, the general errors and the corresponding failures are shown below:

- 100-199 : System board failures
- 200-299 : Memory failures
- 300-399 : Key board failures
- 400-499 : Monochrome video problems
- 500-599 : Color video problems
- 600-699 : Floppy disk errors
- 1700-1799: Hard disk problems.

Some of the frequently encountered error codes and their corresponding error messages on a PC are given below.

| **Error Code** | **Error Message** |	
| 161 |	CMOS battery failure: Replace the CMOS battery |
| 164 |	Memory size error : If the error occurs after memory upgrade, run SETUP program. | 
| 201 |	Memory test failed : RAM chips failed, one or more may need to be replace. |
| 301 |	Keyboard error: You may have to check the key board |

A **toner probe** is an electronic test instrument to help trace wires. One part (the tone generator) induces a tone on a pair of wires, and with the other you part (the tone probe) you can detect the tone at the other end to trace where the wires go. You can trace wires through walls using a tone probe, and determine which pair is carrying the signal you induced at the other end.

A **cable tester** is used to verify that all of the intended connections exist and that there are no unintended connections in the cable being tested. When an intended connection is missing it is said to be "open". When an unintended connection exists it is said to be a "short" (as in short circuit). If a connection "goes to the wrong place" it is said to be "miswired" (the connection has two faults: it is open to the correct contact and shorted to an incorrect contact).

*Difference* between a **Toner Probe** and **Cable Tester**: The main difference between a cable tester and a toner probe is that in the former, you have access to the both ends of the cable at the same time, and you normally to Open or Short testing (to determine right pins are connected), and in the latter, you dont have simultaneous physical access to both ends of the cable. An AT computer will have two interrupt controllers. The second interrupt controller needs to deliver the interrupts through the primary interrupt controller. IRQ2 had been identified for this purpose on the primary and IRQ9 on the secondary interrupt controllers. In other words, IRQ2 and IRQ9 are cascaded.

**AT style systems:** AT style systems use two power connectors, P8 and P9 to connect to the motherboard. ATX systems use only one P1 connector to connect to the motherboard.

**Keyboard Error:** If you are getting a keyboard error, you need to do one of the following things:

- Check if the keyboard needs to be cleaned
- Check if the keyboard cable has become loose
- Check if one or more of the keys are stuck
- If required, replace the keyboard.

**Battery backup:** The battery is supposed to provide backup in the event of any power failure, typically up to 2 hours or more

**Hardware Compatibility List:** The best ways to find whether a new hardware is supported by your Windows OS is to check the manufacturer’s documentation first, and then the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).

**Inverter board:** The inverter board is responsible for converting low voltage DC power to high voltage AC, necessary to light up the back-light bulb. If the inverter board is bad, the LCD screen (back-light bulb) will not light up when you turn on the laptop, but you still should be able to see a very dim image on the screen.

**Pagination Error:** If your error is typical, it will result in random BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) crashes but between crashes, the computer will be usable. Recommended sequence of steps to troubleshoot in a Windows 10 computer:

**First check the hard drive for errors:**

- Open a CMD window as an administrator.
- Type or paste ‘chkdsk /f /r’ and hit Enter.
- Allow the process to complete.

**Then perform a system file check.**

- Open a CMD window as an administrator.
- Type or paste ‘sfc /scannow’ and hit Enter.
- Allow the process to complete.

If problem persists, check **Windows updates and drivers** as they are often the cause of **Page Fault in Non paged Area errors**.

- Navigate to Settings, Update & security.
- Click ‘Check for updates’ in the Windows update tab.
- Allow the process to complete.
- Navigate to Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, Device Manager.
- Select hardware, right click and ‘Update Driver Software’. Make sure you check graphics and audio drivers as well as any third party webcam, printer and other drivers.
- Reboot and retest.

If the **BSOD** still occurs, check the Windows page file.

- Right click ‘This PC’ in Windows Explorer and select Properties.
- Click ‘Advanced system settings’.
- In the Advanced tab click Settings in the Performance box.
- Click Change in the Virtual memory box and uncheck ‘Automatically manage paging files for all drives’.
- Set a custom size for the page file.
- Click Ok.
- Reboot.

Finally, if none of those software methods work, check your **RAM** (physical memory). If your computer has multiple sticks of RAM, remove one and retest. If the fault persists, change the memory slot and retest. If the error keeps occurring, consider replacing your RAM.

**Date and Time Not Set error:** Date and Time Not Set is the most common error that occurs when the BIOS battery is drained. You need to replace the CMOS battery.

**Sporadic Movement of Mouse:** The most likely cause for sporadic movement of mouse is dirt. If dirt has entered the mouse, clean the dirt with IPA, or cotton wetted in soap water.

**Conflicting IRQs:** The most likely problem is conflicting IRQs(Interrupt Request Line). Since the mouse is working until the modem is used, the IRQ/IO address of modem may be conflicting with that of the mouse.

To obtain **BIOS string ID**:

- Power off the system
- Either unplug your keyboard or hold down one of the keys on the keyboard
- Power-on the system and you should get a keyboard error
- The string in the lower left hand corner of your computer screen represents the BIOS String ID.

It is also possible to read the **BIOS information** by going to the BIOS set-up of the PC by pressing appropriate key (usually Del key) during boot up.

Various **POST (Power On Self Test) error codes** and their descriptions below: 

| Code 01: | Undetermined problem |
| Code 02: | Power Supply error Code 1xx: System board errors Code 2xx: Memory (RAM) errors |
|Code 3xx: | Keyboard errors |

Code 6xx: Diskette Drive errors x is any single digit integer.

**The following are true about backup:**

- **Full backup:** Here all files that have been chosen for backup are backed up, irrespective of whether the archive bit is set or not set. Archive bit is set (ON) after backup.

- **Incremental backup:** Here only the files that have been created or have changed since the previous full or incremental backup will be backed up. The archive bit is set after a file is backed up. Incremental backup will backup files that have changed since previous full or incremental backup.

- **Differential backup:** Here, the files that have changed or created since the last full backup will be backed up. Note that, unlike Incremental backup, the archive bit is not set on a differential backup. The result of this is that the next differential backup will include files that were backed up during earlier Differential backups.

**UPS** usually contains a filter to smooth the noise, and this filter is called noise filter.

**x86 (32-bit) operating systems** have a memory limit of 4GB. If you intend to use greater than 4GB of memory, you need to upgrade to x64 bit operating system.

**Startup Repair** can prevent a time-consuming re-installation by diagnosing and repairing problems that prevent Windows from starting.

**Startup Repair:** Startup Repair is designed to start automatically if Windows detects a startup problem. The Startup Repair tool in Windows 7 can help fix problems that prevent Windows from starting up.
