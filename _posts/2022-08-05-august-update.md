I had a plan going into 2022. As [Helmuth von Moltke](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Helmuth-von-Moltke) once famously wrote:
>    Kein Operationsplan reicht mit einiger Sicherheit über das erste Zusammentreffen mit der feindlichen Hauptmacht hinaus. Nur der Laie glaubt in dem Verlauf eines Feldzuges die konsequente Durchführung eines im voraus gefaßten in allen Einzelheiten überlegten und bis ans Ende festgehaltenen, ursprünglichen Gedankens zu erblicken.

>No plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first encounter with the main enemy forces. Only the layman believes that in the course of a campaign he sees the consistent implementation of an original thought that has been considered in advance in every detail and retained to the end.

What I'm trying to say is, nothing goes according to plan, but without a plan you just set yourself up for failure. 

One day I will go into more detail about my past. I had to rebuild my life, and rebuild it in a way that was acceptable to my situation. Everyone has something they are dealing with in their personal life. Everyone has to figure that out, and then make the best of their situations. My plan was to make the best of my situation.  

## Career

I started a new position a few months ago. It's been fantastic, and I'm very fortunate to be a part of the team. I'm learning a lot, and continuing to grow.

## WGU

I’m still attending [WGU](https://mbsy.co/66mVns), and currently studying [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a). I’ve considered doing a study guide, but life is kind of busy at the moment. It’s probably not a course I need a study guide for, but it would make studying for the test more fun. I’ve been building PC’s since the mid 90’s, so it’s not that tough of a course but we’ll see….

## WGU Cyber Club

If you’re new at WGU then I suggest looking into joining the Cyber Club. If you have the time it’s a great place to socialize and network. The Cyber Club offers:
- Tryhackme Nights
- CCDC
- NICE Challenges
- NCL
