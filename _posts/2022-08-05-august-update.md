Life really took some amazing turns in 2022.

In March, I started a new job, and it’s been an incredible experience! I love the team that I joined, and the projects I've been tasked. My “Intro 2022” blog post captures my attitude going into this year, and I continue to be very excited for the future. I’m also very humble, and feel very fortunate to work with such an amazing group of individuals.

I’ve also started to become more active with some volunteer projects. Keeping myself busy is truly a blessing. 

## WGU

I’m still attending [WGU](https://mbsy.co/66mVns), and currently studying [CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a). I’ve considered doing a study guide, but life is kind of busy at the moment. It’s probably not a course I need a study guide for, but it would make studying for the test more fun. I’ve been building PC’s since the mid 90’s, so it’s not that tough of a course but we’ll see….

## WGU Cyber Club

If you’re new at WGU then I suggest looking into joining the Cyber Club. If you have the time it’s a great place to socialize and network. The Cyber Club offers:
- Tryhackme Nights
- CCDC
- NICE Challenges
- NCL
- Fore More visit [WGU Cyber Club](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cyber-club.html)
