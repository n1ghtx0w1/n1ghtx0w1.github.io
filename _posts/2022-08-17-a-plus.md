`In progress`

The **CompTIA A+** is the only industry recognized credential with performance testing to prove pros can think on their feet to perform critical IT support tasks. It is trusted by employers around the world to identify the go-to person in endpoint management & technical support roles. CompTIA A+ appears in more tech support job listings than any other IT credential. 

The CompTIA A+ Core Series requires candidates to pass two exams: **Core 1 (220-1101)** and **Core 2 (220-1102)** covering the following new content, emphasizing the technologies and skills IT pros need to support a hybrid workforce. 

### [About CompTIA A+ Certification](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) 


## Getting Started

I utilized **Udemy**, **Pluralsight**, and **YouTube** videos to ***listen*** to the information first. 

Practice tests helped me gauge my weak points and focus my studying efforts.

The **CertMaster** resource below offers labs, videos, practice exams, domain reviews, and a final practice exam. This resource is probably really good for those who are completely new to tech or lacking experience.

**Professor Messer** comes highly recommended and for good reason. The course notes and study videos are fantastic!

**Video Card**
- a printed circuit board controlling output to a display screen, it is used to render graphics from a simple GUI to a complex 3d game. The more powerful the card, the better the application that it can render.

**RAM Stick**
- These cards hold the computer memory. Any active program, such as the OS, a game, or application, is stored here for quick access by the processor.

**CPU**
- This is the brains of a computer. It handles every process that goes through from the hard drive to the motherboard, managing every element of a computer.
- Central Processing Unit

**AMD, Intel**
- Two of the largest CPU manufacturers

**Motherboard**
- Every piece of the computer is connected either directly or indirectly together from this central point. It is where the CPU is located, controlling every element of the computer.

**Optical Drive**
- These play disk media, such as CD's, DVD's, or blu-ray disks, or some can copy data to special disks in the form of burning data. It uses a laser to read the data on the disk.

**Hard Drive**
- This uses platters to store data by means of magnetic force. It uses actuator arms to record the data to the platters. It is where every element of a program is permanently stored until otherwise deleted by the user, or by accidental means.

**Solid State Drive**
- This uses semiconductors to store data as electronic means. It uses no moving parts, and can be generally quicker than the platter variants. Like its cousin, every element of a program is stored permanently here, until otherwise deleted by the user, by accidental means, or simply by conductor burnout.

**CPU-Z**

**RAM**
- Random Access Memory
- Adding this to a system can greatly increase performance.

**DRAM**
- Dynamic Random Access Memory

**SDRAM**
- Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory
- This type of RAM uses a 168 pin DIMM. It also has 2 notches in it to lock into a MoBo. It is synchronized to the system clock. It used clock speed, which must be matched to the MoBo. Generally it came with a PC rating to match the MoBo. It can still be used in some systems today. It is generally characterized by a double or triple digit PC rating.

**DIMM**
- Dual In-line Memory Module

**DDR**
- Dual Data Rate

**DDR SDRAM**
- This type of RAM uses a 184 pin DIMM. It only has a single notch to match into a MoBo. It was capable of doubling a motherboard clock speed, making the RAM faster. It is generally characterized by 4 digit PC numbers. To calculate speeds, DDR will double the MoBo speeds. For example, 100 MHz becomes 200, 200 MHz becomes 400.

**x8**
- You will take a DDR speed and multiply it by this. For example, if a system is 100 Mhz and DDR SDRAM multiplied the speed to 200 MHz, you would multiply by this number to get the PC rating speed.

**DDR2**
- This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like its lesser counterpart, it uses a single slot to match a MoBo, however it is in a different location, preventing insertion into the wrong MoBo. It not only doubled the speeds like DDR, it also doubled the clock speeds. To calculate speeds, you will double the MoBo speed, then double the number again. The PC rating will have a PC2 number.

**DDR3**
- This type of RAM uses a 240 pin DIMM. Like its counterpart, it also uses a single slot, but it is also located in a different location to prevent insertion into the wrong slots. To calculate the speed, you calculate the MoBo speed x4. Then you will double that speed to get the actual speed of this RAM. This PC rating will have a PC3 number.

**Rambus RAM**
- Characterized by a 184 pin RIMM, this type of RAM is long obsolete. It also has 2 notches to prevent insertion into the wrong MoBo. This type of RAM must always be installed in pairs.

**CRIMM**
- Continuity RIMM
- When installing Rambus RAM modules, this type of stick must always be installed in the empty sockets. It does not have a function other than to terminate.

**Single Sided RAM**
- This type of RAM only has memory on one side of a stick.

**Double Sided RAM**
- This type of RAM has memory on both sides of a stick.

**ECC and parity RAM**
- This type of RAM has extra chips designed for error correcting. It can only be used on motherboards that accept this type of RAM. Generally it is only located on servers.

**SODIMM**
- Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module
- This type of RAM is only used in laptop systems. It has slightly lower capacity than its counterparts, however other than that feature it is nearly identical, except for it being smaller. It comes in 100, 144, 200 pins. 204 pins is unique to DDR3 ram.

**SPD**
- Serial Presence Detect

**MTBF**
- Mean Time Between Failures

**Memtest86**

**Windows Memory Diagnostic**
- This program comes with every Windows 7 and later system. It is located under Administration Tools and helps to diagnose any issues related to memory.

**Software**
- These types of programs are stored on harddrives. They can be changed as often as wanted.

**Firmware**
- These types of programs are stored on chips. They are semi-permanent or permanent programs that enable the system to communicate.

**CMOS**
- Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor

**System BIOS**
- This program is stored on a ROM chip, it enables all of the hardware to communicate to each other.

### RAID Redundant Array of Independent Disks

**RAID** - A group of physical or virtual disks working together

- Increased performance and fault tolerance
- Disks can be hot-swappable

**Hardware RAID** - uses a physical RAID controller

**Software RAID** - manages logical disks using the OS

**RAID 0**

RAID 0 (disk striping) is the process of dividing a body of data into blocks and spreading the data blocks across multiple storage devices, such as hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs), in a redundant array of independent disks (RAID) groups.

<img align="center" src="https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/storage_raid_00_mobile.png" alt="raid-0" width="600" height="300">

**RAID 1**

Disk mirroring, also known as RAID 1, is the replication of data to two or more disks. Disk mirroring is a good choice for applications that require high performance and high availability, such as transactional applications, email and operating systems.

<img align="center" src="https://www.prepressure.com/images/raid-level-1-mirroring.svg" alt="raid-1" width="600" height="300">

**RAID 5**

RAID 5 is a redundant array of independent disk configuration that uses disk striping with parity. Because data and parity are striped evenly across all of the disks, no single disk is a bottleneck. Striping also allows users to reconstruct data in case of a disk failure.

<img align="center" src="https://www.prepressure.com/images/raid-level-5-striping-with-parity.svg" alt="raid-5" width="600" height="300">

**RAID 10**

Also known as RAID 1+0, is a RAID configuration that combines disk mirroring and disk striping to protect data. It requires a minimum of four disks and stripes data across mirrored pairs. As long as one disk in each mirrored pair is functional, data can be retrieved.

<img align="center" src="https://itenterpriser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/What-is-RAID-10.jpg" alt="raid-10" width="600" height="300">

**RAID 50**

Known as RAID 5+0, combines distributed parity (RAID 5) with striping (RAID 0). It requires a minimum of six drives. This RAID level offers better write performance, increased data protection and faster rebuilds than RAID 5.

### Printers

**Laser**

- Laser writes negatively charged areas to the drum
- Positively charged toner is then attracted to the drum
- Pickup rollers bring paper into the printer
- Separation pad ensures that a single piece of paper is fed into the printer
- Toner on drum is then transferred to negatively charged paper via the transfer belt, part of the fuser assembly

[**Professor Messer Laser Printers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWQFd8GKtc)

**Inkjet**

- Uses ink cartridges moved across paper by a carriage belt
- Rollers feed paper into the printer
- Pressure or electrical pulses force ink out of tiny nozzles
- Cartridge nozzle calibration
- Cartridge replacement is expensive
- Consider print pages per minute (PPM)
 - 30 PPM = 30 pages of text

[**Professor Messer Inkjet Printers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbRnoUzGxNA)

**Thermal**

- Common with POS receipts
- Uses coated paper (use the correct heat sensitivity paper)
- Regions on the paper are heated to form the printout and then darken

[**Professor Messer Thermal Printers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JXzHJRijCY)

**Impact**

- Dot matrix printers
- A print head uses electrical charges for pins to form shapes
- Print head pins impact paper through an ink ribbon to form characters on paper
- Useful for printing multiple carbon copies in one print pass

[**Professor Messer Impact Printers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FtvlNrzUA8)

**3D**

- Useful for creating simple replacement parts, product prototyping
- 3D modeling using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software
- Uses material layering to create physical objects on the print bed

**Consumables:**

- Wax
- Plastic compound (filament)
- 3D printer resin
- Powder and glue

- Rendered 3D objects may need time to dry or cure

[**Professor Messer 3D Printers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoZoLWLCBfc)

**Printer Interfaces and Maintenance**

Interfaces: USB, Ethernet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi
Client printer drivers, permissions to print (ACL, smartcard)

Consumables: Replace paper, toner, ink, wax, plastic/resin, powder, glue

Clean rollers, clear paper jams, remove printing debris
