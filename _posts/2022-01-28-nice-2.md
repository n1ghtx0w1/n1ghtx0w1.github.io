**Summary of Today's Challenge**

### Preventative Protection: Thwarting the Imminent Threat

`On January 23, 2022, at approximately 16:30 hours CST, I was given notice of an impending EternalBlue style attack on the corporate domain controller.`

The debrief:

**From:  Ione Leventis**

>*"Hold on, I think I've narrowed a few possible attack vectors down. I'm fairly > certain the attacker plans on using the EternalBlue exploit to compromise our server. @playerone, I need you to make sure that our Domain-Controller system is protected so that EternalBlue will no longer effect it. I still don't have a time frame as to when this attack is going to happen so you need to get that machine secured as quickly as possible."*

Fortunately I have some familiarty with this exploit having practiced in my own home labs.  I still found documentation such as this to be extremely helpful in thrwarting the incoming attack:

  - [ms17-010](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/  2017/ms17-010)

  - [Disable SMB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/troubleshoot/detect-enable-and-disable-smbv1-v2-v3) 

## Course of Action

Connected to the domain controller 172.16.30.5, opened up powershell, and ran the following commands:

> `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol`

> `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB2Protoco`

> `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol`

> `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB2Protocol`

> `Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB1Protocol $false`

> `Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB2Protocol $false`

Then, I, checked the services to make sure they were disabled with the following commands:

> `Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select EnableSMB1Protocol`

> `Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select EnableSMB2Protocol`

Both commands resulted in responses indicating the services were no longer running "false" **thwarting** the impending attack.

Each NICE Challenge has the following core elements: a narrative-driven scenario, a business environment (workspace), and a set of technical objectives and/or a written deliverable. Each of these elements is developed to immerse the player (student) in a real-world experience and create a valuable set of data allowing their curator (educator) to judge their readiness for the workforce.
