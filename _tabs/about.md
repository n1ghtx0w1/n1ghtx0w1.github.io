I’m a line of duty injured, retired, law enforcement officer that has transitioned into tech. I still have a passion for protecting people and assets. Hacking is a hobby and I advocate learning. My learning has helped me get my mind off my medical issues so I understand how it may be helpful to others.

I’m a member of the WGU Cyber Security Club participating in [NCL](https://cyberskyline.com/), [NICE Challenges](https://nice-challenge.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/), [ImmersiveLabs](https://www.immersivelabs.com/), and much more.
